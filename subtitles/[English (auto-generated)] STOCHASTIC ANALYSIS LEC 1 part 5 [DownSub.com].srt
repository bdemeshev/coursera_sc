00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,560
In this video we will discuss a wide useful class of

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,380
random processes martingales.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,500
We will use martingales to price assets

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,299
claims in the framework of Black

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,119
and Scholes models, but let's start first

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,400
with the filtration. Filtration is a

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,359
concept to model information acquisition.

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,279
Then we will define a martingale, and

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,460
then we will provide some examples of

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,920
martingales.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,520
Okay, what a filtration is? The sigma

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,160
algebra FT describes all the information

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,000
available at time T, and if an agent is

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,379
rational, if he has a perfect memory, then,

17
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,200
his knowledge grows in time. So, that's a

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
formal definition of a filtration. The

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,899
family of sigma algebras FT indexed by a

20
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,719
time variable T is called filtration, if

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,739
it grows in time. So, basically FS is a

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,360
subset of FT for S less or equal to T. I

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,780
just remind you, that sigma algebra FT is

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,260
a collection of events.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,960
What is a natural filtration? If you have

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,119
a process. If you observe, for example, a

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,040
process XT, and all you know

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,939
is the past values of XT, then your

29
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,000
knowledge is called natural filtration.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,280
So, basically, natural filtration of a

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,259
process

32
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,659
describes the information of rational

33
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,720
agent, who knows past value of the

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,280
process. So, FT is generated by all random

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,220
variables XU for U from 0 to T.

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,380
Let's consider an example

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,140
of a Wiener process and its natural

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,060
filtration FT. One example: the event W2

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,420
is less, than 5 belongs to sigma algebra

40
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,420
F2, because at time moment 2, you know the

41
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,639
value of W2, and you know, whether it's

42
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,760
greater than 5 or less than 5.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,680
The event W2 is greater than W5. This

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,140
event you know it at time moment 6,

45
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,879
whether this event has happened or not

46
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,459
happened, so, this event belongs to the

47
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,080
sigma algebra F6.

48
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,660
But, for example, if you can see the the

49
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,020
event W2 is less than 5, this event

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,620
does not belong to the list to the sigma

51
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,000
algebra F1, because  at time moment 1

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
you don't know, whether  W2 is less

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,060
that 5. And in  a similar fashion

54
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,720
W2 greater than W5 this, is that event

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,360
does not belong to the sigma algebra F2,

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,900
because at time moment 2 you don't have

57
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,540
enough information to decide, whether

58
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,760
this event has happened or not happened.

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,980
Now we are ready to define a martingale.

60
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,440
We can see the filtration FT a process

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,780
MT.

62
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,180
And if the best prediction of the future

63
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,319
value of a process MT is its current

64
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,120
value MS.

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,700
So, expected value of MT given sigma

66
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,659
algebra FS is MS, then MT is called a

67
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,400
martingale with respect to the

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,220
filtration FT.

69
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,260
So, what does this mean? This means, that,

70
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,700
basically, future changes are zero on

71
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,099
average. So, if I'm trying to predict the

72
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,080
future value of a process,

73
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,420
then the best prediction is its current

74
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,780
value, and so, I predict future

75
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,500
changes as zero. And usually we consider

76
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,780
a natural filtration FT of a process

77
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,220
MT.

78
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,980
Let's consider first very simple example

79
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,540
a constant process. If MT is always

80
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,760
777, that's the best forecast for future

81
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,220
value of MT given current information

82
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,440
is

83
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,478
777, so its current value.

84
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,079
Or another important example for us is a

85
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,360
Wiener process.

86
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,720
The best forecast of WT given current

87
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,320
information FS, I remind you that S is

88
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,300
before T.

89
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,020
I decompose future value WT, as current

90
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,780
value WS plus change.

91
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,180
Then I use the fact, that WS is known at

92
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,639
time moment test, so, I move it out of the

93
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,880
expected value. But future change WT

94
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,699
minus WS

95
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,960
is independent of FS. So, I remove a

96
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,300
conditional expected, I remove

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,000
information. And, conditional expected

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,979
value is equal to the unconditional one

99
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,340
and, hence, I get WS.

100
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,540
Let's consider one more example: ZT that

101
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,020
is equal to WT squared minus T is also a

102
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,759
martingale with respect to the natural

103
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,699
filtration of Wiener process. Let's check

104
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,479
this. We calculate expected value of

105
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,600
future value of the process, given

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,240
current information FS. So, time moment S

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,520
is before time moment T.

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,280
Once again we use the same trick as

109
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,240
always: with a compose future value WT as

110
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,979
a WS current value plus change WT minus

111
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,699
WS. Then we open

112
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,699
the A plus B squared, as A squared plus B

113
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,440
squared plus 2 times A times B.

114
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,740
T is a deterministic variable, so we move

115
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,440
it out of the expected value. And we

116
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,800
simplify. Basically, for simplification we

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,720
use

118
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,500
the two ideas: the first idea, that WS is

119
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,560
known at time moment S. So, we move it out

120
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,440
of the expected value like T.

121
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,380
And the second idea:

122
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,740
future change WT minus WS, or the

123
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,979
square root value of WT minus WS is

124
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,460
independent of current information FS, so

125
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,419
we emit our information sigma algebra FS.

126
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,240
And then, the last step:

127
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,259
we use the fact that WT minus WS has

128
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,360
normal distribution which means zero and

129
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,360
variance T minus S. So, we get the final

130
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,500
answer WS squared plus T minus S minus T

131
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,440
or WS squared minus S, that is ZS, so, the

132
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,199
process that T we are discussing is

133
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,900
indeed a martingale. One more example of

134
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,360
a martingale is a process ZT, that is

135
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,500
exponent of a times WT minus a squared T

136
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,620
over 2. This is a martingale for every

137
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,380
possible value of a constant A, and this

138
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,319
martingale is extremely useful in

139
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,759
pricing

140
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,039
financial claims in the Black and

141
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,419
Scholes model.

142
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,419
The concept of a martingale also works

143
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:28,259
in discrete time. So, imagine a filtration

144
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,759
FT, T now is a natural number zero, one,

145
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,380
two and so on. And the process MT  is

146
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,259
also defined for natural values of T

147
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,139
like 0, 1, 2 and so on.

148
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,780
And in discrete time, instead of checking,

149
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,319
that expected value of any future MT,

150
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,960
given current information FS is equal to

151
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,500
current value of S. This condition is

152
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,099
equivalent to a much simpler condition,

153
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,639
that expected value of the next value of

154
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,539
the process of MT plus 1, given a

155
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,180
current information FT is current value

156
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,800
empty.

157
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,860
So, it's much easier to check, that the

158
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,440
process is a martingale in discrete time

159
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,440
then in continuous time.

160
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,979
And for example, we will consider a very

161
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,020
famous process, that is called random

162
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,860
walk.

163
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,440
So, we have a sequence of identically

164
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,900
distributed and independent random

165
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,899
variables set: 1, Z2, Z3, and so on with

166
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,659
expected value of each random variable

167
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,520
equal to zero.

168
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,059
And if we calculate cumulative sum of

169
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,140
these variables. So, ST is Z1 plus A2,

170
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,820
plus ZT with initial value, as 0

171
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,580
equal to zero.

172
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,760
This process is called a random walk, and

173
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,600
the random walk is a martingale.

174
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,080
Let's describe our information: FT at

175
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,380
time moment T, we know, that one the two,

176
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,380
that three and so on ZT.

177
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,140
And if we will calculate expected value

178
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,380
of future ST, plus 1 given current

179
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,160
information FT. Then, we decompose ST

180
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,820
plus 1, as St plus change the T plus one

181
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,700
always the same logic future value is

182
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,339
current value plus change.

183
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:34,560
Then ST is known at time moment T. We

184
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,540
have enough information in sigma algebra

185
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,320
FT to calculate ST. So, we move it out of

186
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,120
the expected value.

187
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,019
And ZT plus 1 is independent of sigma

188
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,140
algebra FT, hence, when calculating

189
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,600
conditional expected value of ZT plus

190
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,120
one we are just calculating ordinary

191
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,339
unconditional expected value of the T

192
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,800
plus one and ordinary expected value of

193
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,480
ZT plus 1 is 0. So, we get SG and the

194
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,160
random walk is a martingale.

195
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,480
Let's recap: filtration or a sequence of

196
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,200
sigma algebras models the process of

197
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,560
information acquisition.

198
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,680
We have defined the concept of a

199
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,899
martingale. A Martingale is a very

200
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,660
special type of stochastic process, where

201
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,180
the best guess of future value of the

202
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,959
process is its current value.

203
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,959
And we have provided some examples

204
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,540
related to a WIener process.
