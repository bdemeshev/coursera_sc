3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,940
In this video we will discuss an important class of stochastic processes in

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,760
continuous time ETA processes.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,160
First, we will start with the definition,

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,859
then we will discuss, how to check,

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,680
whether the Ito process is a martingale

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,920
or not. And then we will provide two

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,359
forms, how we may write down the Ito

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,660
process.

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,880
First, the definition - the stochastic

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,520
process is called Ito process, if it can

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,760
be represented, as a sum of three terms a

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,520
constant Y0,

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,579
the second term is a Ito integral from 0

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,860
to T of AU times dWu plus the third

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,640
term: the ordinary integral from 0 to T

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,140
of BU times DU.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,260
This wide class of continuous time

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,080
stochastic processes

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,100
has a a very simple intuitive property,

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,640
they behave locally like a Wiener

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,659
process with drift.

24
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,580
And we have an informal theorem for

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,200
Ito processes.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,720
If the Riemann integral is absent in

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,420
their representation of an Ito process, so,

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,979
YT is just Y0, a constant plus an Ito

29
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,659
integral from 0 to T of AU times dWu, in

30
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,340
this case,  the 

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,400
Ito process is a martingale. So, the best

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,600
guess of future value of an integral

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,200
plus constant is its current value. So,

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,740
expected value of YT given sigma algebra

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:02,759
information FS is just YS for S, less

36
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,380
or equal than T.

37
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,180
And we may also discuss the expected

38
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,060
value of an Ito process. For any

39
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,640
reasonable process BT we have an

40
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,980
informal theorem, that expected value of

41
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,180
ordinary Riemann integral from 0 to T of

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,260
BU times DU is just integral of the

43
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,920
expected value of BU times DU.

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,040
Basically, that is very intuitive, because

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,680
integral is just the sum expected value

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,340
of a sum, is a sum of expected 

47
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,459
values. So, basically the the idea of the

48
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,560
proof of this theorem is to interchange

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,000
the order of summation and 

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,280
expectation.

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,099
And, hence,

52
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,739
if we have the representation of an Ito

53
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,819
process like YT is Y0 plus stochastic

54
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,000
integral plus Riemann integral, then

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,599
expected value of YT is just Y0,

56
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,780
because it's a constant plus integral

57
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,720
from 0 to T of expected value of BU

58
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,019
times DU, because expected value of

59
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,000
stochastic integral is zero.

60
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,659
When we write the Ito process in the

61
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,879
full form, we need to write integrals, we

62
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,940
write YT equals to Y0 plus C integral

63
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,599
plus C integral, we need to write

64
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,599
this limits of integration

65
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,159
and to save space.

66
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,280
We will use this short form instead of

67
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,700
YT is the sum of Y0 plus

68
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,500
Ito integral plus three in an integral,

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,580
we will just use the compact short form

70
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,680
notation dYt equals to 80 times DWT

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,879
plus BT times DT. So, this is just a

72
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,120
shorthand notation, there are no special

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,540
meaning in dYt. That's not a random

74
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,979
variable, that's not a constant dYt

75
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:18,320
does not exist.

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,340
DWT does not exist.

77
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,240
dYt equals to AT times DWT plus BT

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,320
times DT, is only a compact counterpart

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,440
of the full form, when we write a short

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,100
form we really mean the full form.

81
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:45,139
Once again, DWT and dYt have no meaning.

82
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,560
Short form is  very useful probably in

83
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,080
simulations, because if we'd like to

84
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,259
simulate a stochastic time pass

85
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,100
of YT equals to Y0 plus

86
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,580
Ito integral plus Riemann integral. And

87
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,280
when we write the corresponding short

88
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,900
form dYt equals to 80 times DWT plus

89
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,660
BT times DT. Then we just think of a

90
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,880
small change  in time.  Let's imagine,

91
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,699
that the time changes by delta.

92
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,440
And, hence, the delta of our process Y

93
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,800
tYt plus delta minus Yt is

94
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,160
approximately equal to 80 times the

95
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,220
change of Wiener process WT plus delta

96
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,539
minus WT plus BT times the change of

97
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,979
times so times delta. And to simulate, to

98
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,460
run a simulation, we just create 

99
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,660
randomly WT plus delta minus WT, using

100
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,360
normal distribution whith means 0 and

101
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,780
variance delta. So, this short form is

102
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,060
very useful in computer simulations.

103
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,900
Let's

104
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,740
look at one example. If I write DWT

105
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,520
equals to YT power 4 times DWT,

106
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,120
that basically means,

107
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,900
that YT is equal to Y0 plus integral

108
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,660
from 0 to TW power 4 times dWu.

109
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,680
If I write dYt equals to cosine of WT

110
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,060
times DT, I really mean, that YT equals

111
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,240
to Y0 plus integral from 0 to T cosine

112
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,220
of W Times DU.

113
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,680
And, hence,  using short form notation,

114
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,800
we may restate our informal theorem.

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,580
Ito process YT is a martingale, if and

116
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,500
only if, in the short form it is

117
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,400
written like dYt equals to 80 times dWt.

118
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,100


119
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,240
So, let's check a summary.

120
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,780
Ito  process is a sum of three terms a

121
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,139
constant and Ito integral, and all our old

122
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,020
friend Riemann integral.

123
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,099
Ito process will be a martingale

124
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:23,400
without Riemann integral in this sum.

125
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,840
And we often use short form with DT and

126
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,060
DWT. And, once again, DWT has no meaning,

127
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,539
it's just a short form to write less, and

128
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,300
we really mean a full form, when we write

129
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,139
a short form.
