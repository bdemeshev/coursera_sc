[Music]

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,540
In this video we will simulate the trajectory of

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,059
stochastic differential equation. We will

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,340
use a code, we have created during two

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,099
previous weeks.

7
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:16,940
And we will simulate the trajectory of

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,480
risk of interest rate and the Vacicek

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,320
interest rate model. Initial value is 007,

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,740
and the stochastic differential equation,

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,199
that governs the dynamics of interest

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,620
rate: is DRT equals to

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,000
005 minus Rt times Dt plus 0 0 2 times

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
dWt.

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,239
Okay, let's create our function.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,860
Def get as a solution.

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,379
We should specify the final moment of

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:03,480
time. We should specify the number of segments.

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,000
And we will specify initial value.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,860
Okay, first, we will calculate them,

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,540
deltas of Wiener process.  Delta W will

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,479
be get winner increments of T.

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,240
And, so, we will need also seed here.

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,420
Seed will be none by default.

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,220
We will need T and and seed. Okay, we

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,439
got Brownian motion increments.

31
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,340
then we will calculate the trajectory of Wiener process.

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,140
We have already done this.

34
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:01,680
We can just copy these part of the code from the previous function.

38
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,219
Okay, we got the values of Wiener process,

39
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,880
the values of time stamps.

40
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,920
Then let's say Dt is T Over N to

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,700
simplify some calculations.

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,640
Okay, let's create that trajectory of our

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,080
solution R, that trajectory of R. First, we

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,180
will fill it with zeros.

45
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,879
We will get N plus one zeros.

46
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:39,620
Initial value is specified by our R0.

47
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,360
And then we will create a big cycle. We

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,000
will calculate the values of R one by one.

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,599
So, four I in range N.

52
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,060
What should we do? We should calculate

53
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,420
the delta R, and we should add it to the

54
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,239
previous value. So, basically, the logic is

55
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,440
very simple. First, we calculate delta R,

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,260
then we say, that our number I plus 1 is

57
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,540
equal to R number I plus delta R.

59
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,340
And, basically, we return that trajectory.

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,940
Okay, how delta R is calculated, and this

61
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,180
is exactly our stochastic differential

62
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,379
equation. So, basically we may copy it.

63
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:42,700
Okay, we will copy it here. And we replace

65
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,819
our Dt is Dt. So, we just add here

66
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:51,060
multiplied by Dt. What is RT? RT is a

67
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,799
previous value of our process R. So, it

68
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,420
will be Ri.

69
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,720
Okay, and here we got 0 0 2 times Dw. And

70
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:12,560
what is dWt? It is a delta W number I.

72
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,959
And we are done. So, let's check, whether

73
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,979
everything works.

74
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,100
We should provide some initial value for

75
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,259
R0. Let it be 0 0 5.

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,120
Okay, and now let's see the trajectory.

78
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,340
Okay, let's create, T will be

79
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,900
get time from T from T equal to 0 up to three.

81
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,460
Yeah, I don't know the initial value was 0 0 7.

83
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,280
Okay, we got the time, we go to 3 N

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,199
equal to one thousand.

85
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,160
Maybe, we should make them,

86
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,759
maybe, we should write them before

87
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:21,680
our function. Okay, T, and then we got T and N.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,600
Then we will get the trajectory. R will

90
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,340
be get, as the solution.

92
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,759
Let me say T and R0 equal to 0 0 7.

95
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,340
And that's all.

96
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,199
Now we may plot our solution.

97
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,680
We use the C born line plot function.

98
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,520
The horizontal, on the horizontal axis we

99
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,479
will plot our time stamps. On the

100
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,060
vertical axis we will plot our

101
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:17,820
trajectory of our risk-free interest rate.

104
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,100
And we see, that this risk-free rate fluctuates around some

106
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,819
value. Let's check, how the plot will

107
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,180
change, if we will use different values.

109
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,039
So, let it be more sensible to the

110
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,479
deviations from the long run equilibrium.

111
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,740
So, let's multiply here by two. Yeah, let's

112
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,300
change a little bit the equation, let's

113
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,319
multiply here by 5. So, this will make

114
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,840
our trajectory very sensitive to the

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,400
deviations from these 0 0 5.

116
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,440
When RT will be much bigger than 0 0 5,

117
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,500
this term will be

118
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,259
negative and big by absolute value. So,

119
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,660
the interest rate should feel the

120
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,740
pressure to go down to value 0 0 5. So,

121
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,900
let's multiply by 5.

122
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,180
Well, multiply by 5 here.

123
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:29,599
Okay, and let's look what will change.

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,620
Okay, and we see that it goes from 0 0 7

125
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,380
to 0 0 5 or faster.

127
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,900
And we can experiment, then we can study

128
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,300
the properties of stochastic

129
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,539
differential equations solutions  in this manner.
