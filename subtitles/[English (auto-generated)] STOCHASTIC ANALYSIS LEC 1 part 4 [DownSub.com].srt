3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,720
Let's move on to conditional values now.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,059
First, start with conditional expected

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,660
value of 7W6 squared given, that we know

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,100
W at time moment 4. Okay, we will use the

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,240
same trick on the future value W6. We

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,600
will represent it, as past value W for

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,619
known value, plus increment, that means W6

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,019
minus W4.

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,340
If we do this substitution, we will get

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,340
7 times expected value of

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,460
W4 plus brackets W6 minus W4 squared,

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,440
given that we know W4.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,120
And now let's open the brackets inside

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,960
the square. Okay, we get 7 times

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,459
expectation of W4 squared plus W6

18
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,360
minus W4 squared plus

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,080
2 times W4 times increment W6 minus W4

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,600
given, that we know W4.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,460
Now there are basically two cases, we

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,000
need to consider. W4 is completely

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,700
known to us. So, we work with W4, as with a

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,100
constant, so we will move it out of

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,240
conditional expectation.

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,520
And the increment

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,540
W6 minus W4 is independent of what we

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,780
know of W4.

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,200
Okay, we get 7 times

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,960
W4 squared is fixed, we know it.  Plus

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,619
W6 minus W4 squared is independent of

32
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,899
what we know, so, we replace conditional

33
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,840
expected value with unconditional one.

34
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,099
Plus

35
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,300
we take out 2 times W4, we take out what

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,720
is known out of the expected value. And

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,640
when we take

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,920
conditional expected value of the

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,879
increment, we can forget W for our

40
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,739
information.

41
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,379
Okay, what do we know about the

42
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,480
increments of Wiener process? The

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,060
increments of Wiener process are

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,459
normally distributed with means zero and

45
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,060
variance T minus S, when T is greater

46
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,400
then S. So,

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,760
we get 7 times brackets W 4 squared plus.

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,760
The expectation of W6 minus W4 squared

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,780
is basically the variance of W6 minus W4.

50
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,819
So, it will be 6 minus 4, this value we

51
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,860
may treat it, as expected value of W6

52
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,519
minus W4 squared going or we may say

53
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,239
that it's a variance of W6 minus W 4

54
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,940
that's 6 minus 4.

55
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,440
And we get plus 2 times W4 times

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,379
expected value of increment and expected

57
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,500
value of the increment is zero.

58
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,480
Hence, we get our final answer. 7 times W

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,700
4 squared plus 14.

60
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,840
Let's move on to the variance.

61
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,799
We calculate the variance of two W6

62
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,080
plus W5 given, that we know W4.

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,140
Once again. We will decompose future

64
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,280
values into increments plus plus past

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,220
values, but we have two random variables

66
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,680
here, so we will need two increments.

67
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,040
Let's do this.

68
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Basically, we consider time moment

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,620
for time, moment 5, and time moment 6.

70
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,880
We will work with W4

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,220
the increment W5 minus W4 and the

72
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,460
increment W6 minus W5.

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,380
And using this idea of three

74
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,560
independent random variables, our

75
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,620
calculations will be much easier. Let's

76
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,040
do it.

77
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,840
Okay, we will have variance of two, I

78
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,139
will write W6 minus W5

79
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,680
to work with increment. Okay, but I have a

80
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,199
plus one W5, 

81
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,139
so I will put everything back, so, I will

82
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,100
write three W5, so ,I have two w six and

83
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,300
one W5 as I wish. And now I will write

84
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,660
minus three W4,

85
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,160
and I will put them back plus three W4

86
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,860
four given W4.

87
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,460
Okay, this expression now I see, that I

88
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,580
have one increment, the second

89
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,759
independent increment and past value,

90
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,740
that I know. Okay,

91
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,320
my calculations are almost finished.

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,199
I have variance of 2 times W6 minus W5

93
00:05:52,199 --> 00:06:00,539
plus 3 times W5 minus W4. I know W4, so, it

94
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,440
does not influence the variance and it's

95
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,960
independent of two other increments, so,

96
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,020
while I will simply emit my

97
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,960
last term. and I will emit my information,

98
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,139
because these two increments are

99
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,960
independent of what I know. So, I just

100
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,000
write

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,840


102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,759
bracket here.

103
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,020
And I have

104
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,740
four times variance of W6 minus W5 plus

105
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:40,080
9 times variance of W5 minus W4.

106
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,840
Once again the variance of incremental

107
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,319
Wiener process is just difference of

108
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,720
time.

109
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,860
And I have 4 times 6 minus 5 plus

110
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,180
9

111
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,220
times 5 minus 4, and I get

112
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,120
13.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,039
Let's move on to the last case to the

114
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,100
probability. We will estimate, sorry,

115
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,360
calculate probability, that 3 times W6 is

116
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,300
greater than 2 given, that we know W4.

117
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,919
Okay.

118
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,440
Let's subtract conditional expected

119
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,539
value, let's divide by conditional

120
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,880
variance and we will have a standard

121
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,699
normal distribution, and we can use CDF

122
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,680
cumulative distribution function to get

123
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,060
probability.

124
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,900
Okay, so, we just stop for the

125
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,800
moment,

126
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,940
and we calculate

127
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,280
 conditional expected value of three w

128
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,099
6  given W4 it will be three. 

129
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:56,580
Times  expected value of W6 given W4.

130
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,599
And, using our  famous trick of

131
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,000
decomposing future value into past value,

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,580
that is known plus independent increment,

133
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,979
we will get three times w 4.

134
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,220
If we do the same thing with

135
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,180
variance, variance of three w6 given

136
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,900
W4 will be 9 times variance of W6 given

137
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,919
W4.

138
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,120
I use my decomposition variance of W4

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,320
plus W6 minus W4, given W4.

140
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,080
This term

141
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,080
is fixed.

142
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,459
So, it is not influencing variance. And

143
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,140
the increment

144
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,260
is independent.

145
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,779
This one is fixed the other one is

146
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:01,980
independent.

147
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,300
So, I remove a fixed term that is known,

148
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,940
that does not influence variance.

149
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,959
And I get

150
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:21,300
9 times variance of W6 minus W4, given W4.

151
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,180
And here we have independence, and we can

152
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,820
just emit our information, it's useless.

153
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,779
And the variance of  increment of

154
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,420
Wiener process is just difference of

155
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,980
time moments. So, we get 9 times 6 minus 4

156
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,320
we get 18.

157
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,399
So,

158
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,100
to calculate this probability, we need to

159
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,160
standardize a random variable. So, we

160
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,580
subtract variance, we divide by square

161
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,580
root of variance, and we get the answer.

162
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,240
Okay, so, we will have here probability of

163
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,880
three W6 minus. We subtract

164
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,700
conditional expected value.

165
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,760
We subtract

166
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,540
3 W4,

167
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,000
we divide by square root of variance

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,800
conditional variance.

169
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,660
We do the same thing with 2 2 minus 3W

170
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:25,920
4 divided by square root of 18. Even W4.

171
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,940
Hence,

172
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,260
this left hand side has normal 0,1

173
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,640
distribution.

174
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,580
And that is known value,

175
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,700
so, we get

176
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,920
our last step.

177
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,540
We get 1 minus probability, that a

178
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,540
standard normal random variable will be

179
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,740
less

180
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,660
than

181
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,920


182
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,920
two minus 3 W4 divided over 18 given

183
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,540
that W4, we treat at as a constant.And

184
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,320
finally, we get 1 minus cumulative

185
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,579
distribution function at the point 2

186
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:19,260
minus 3 W4 divided by square root of

187
