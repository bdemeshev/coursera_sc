3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,540
Let's calculate the price of an asset in

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,760
the framework of Black and Scholes model in this video.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,920
We will use our previous results.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,080
And then let's describe a contractor of a European type.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,760
So, the contract pays you St. So, basically,

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,240
you receive one share, if as the price of

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,420
a share Su was never before 120

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,960
before time moment big T. And the

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,899
initial values are the following: as zero

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,059
the initial price of a share is 100, are

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,480
the risk-free interest rate is 0 0 5

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,860
sigma, the volatility is equal to 01

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
And the T, the final moment of time is

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,840
three. So, basically here is the problem.

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,619
We have an asset, that pays you St,

22
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,200
basically, gives you a share under some

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,420
conditions, not always you may receive

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,340
zero, you may receive one share, you may

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,900
receive Sd or you may receive zero. Okay,

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,979
and let's do experiments to solve this pricing problem.

28
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,680
Okay, let's subdivide the time interval

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,340
from 0 to T into 1000 smaller time

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,680
intervals. We will consider a discrete

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,159
version of our continuous time process.

32
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,040
Then we will specify the number of simulations.

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,060
Let us have ten thousands of simulations.

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,159
And let's calculate the final price of

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
our asset in every simulation. So, we will

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,960
keep track of final price of our asset.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,979
So, we will reserve memory, so, we will

40
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,399
say numpty zeros, and we will reserve

41
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,459
space for N number of simulation values.

42
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,080
Okay, now the cycle.

44
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,920
For I in range and sim, so, that means I

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,099
will repeat this and same times.

46
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,580
First, I will calculate the trajectory of

47
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,560
Wiener process, I will calculate the

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,800
trajectory of share price, I will

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
calculate the final price of my asset,

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,220
and I just keep track of the final price.

51
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,640
Okay, so, let's create that trajectory of

52
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,459
our Wiener process get, Wiener trajectory.

54
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,819
We say T equal to T here and equal to N.

55
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,540
Okay, then we get that trajectory of timestamps.

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,500
And get time T equal to T and equal to N.

58
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,000
Then we create the trajectory of share

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,200
price. S will be equal to S0 times exponent of

61
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:31,400
here we have R minus sigma square root over two

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,300
times Te plus sigma times W. So, that's the

66
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,140
trajectory of share price in the Black and Scholes model.

68
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,140
Then we just calculate final price.

69
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,640
Now final price number I

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,319
is equal to S. The last value will have number n.

72
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,920
And the final price is equal to this

73
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,980
N only under the condition, that

74
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:20,920
maximal value of S is below 120.

77
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:25,199
Okay, basically, that's all we launch our

78
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,720
cycle, we wait a little bit.

79
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,400
And we need to calculate the discounted

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,840
expected value. So, we just calculate the discounted average.

82
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,900
In our terms, that would be exponent

83
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:56,660
of minus R times t, times mean value of our final prices.

85
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:03,300
And here we are. We have calculated the

86
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,500
fair price, the non-arbitrage price in

87
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
the framework of Black and Scholes model.

88
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,320
We should also check, whether our

89
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,960
experiments are stable or not. Let's just

90
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:23,380
relaunch this once again and see, if the price will fluctuate a lot.

92
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,220
Okay, we repeat our experiment, we check,

93
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,039
that, yeah, that's roughly the same value.

94
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,280
If we'd like to increase precision, we

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,740
should consider bigger value of N and

96
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,560
bigger value of number of simulations,

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,539
but, basically, our conclusion, that the

98
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,380
fair price of this asset is 38. Let's

99
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,680
analyze a little bit. How the

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,320
volatility of the share price will

101
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,220
influence the price of our asset? So,

102
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,560
let's, for example, increase the volatility of a share price.

104
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,380
So, let's edit to here, what will happen

105
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,600
with the price of our asset? Will it go

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,120
down, will it go up?

107
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,160
Okay, we just redo our experiments.

109
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,180
The previous value was roughly 38.

110
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,240
And now we got 23. So, when we increase at

111
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,639
least, that for these values, we have

112
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,560
considered. When we increase the

113
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,500
volatility of a share price, we see, that

114
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,880
the price of our asset goes down.

116
