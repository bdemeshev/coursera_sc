3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:09,599
Let's get used to the Ito's lemma by considering  two examples.

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,780
We have two stochastic processes: we have

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,340
XD, that is T cube times WT squared and YT,

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,580
as ST squared, where ST has the same

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,160
dynamics, as the share price in a Black and

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,760
Scholes model. And we need to find DX DY,

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,740
and to recover the full form

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,019
corresponding to the short form with DX

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,279
and DY.

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,800
Let's do it.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,500
Let's start with DX.


15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
So, Ito's lemma says, that we should take the

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,059
derivative with respect to time. So, what

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,620
is the derivative with respect to time?

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,440
It's 3T squared times WT

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,480
squared times DT.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,879
Plus.

21
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,500
We should add the first derivative with

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,940
respect to our stochastic process WT. So,

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,540
it will be T Cube times 2 WT

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,040
times GWT plus. And Ito's lemma says, that

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,280
contrary to the ordinary usual 

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,619
calculus, in stochastic calculus we

27
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,280
should add one more correction term. So,

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,799
we should add 1 over 2.

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,259
The second derivative with respect to

30
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,479
WT. So, it will be T Cube times two times

31
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,259
DWT squared.

32
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,220
And we need to simplify dWt squared.

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,020
And we have

34
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,200
two simplifications rule.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Okay, our rules to simplify are: DWT times,

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,439
DWT is always equal to DT,

37
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,119
and DT times the anything is zero. So, I

38
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,420
will write separately DT times DT is 0.

39
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,239
And DT times dWt is also zero. So, we

40
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,080
have basically this simplification rules.

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,540
So, our DWT will be equal to DT.

42
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,120
And, hence, we may write:

43
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,000
three T squared

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,980
WT squared times DT

45
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,500
plus

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,580
2T cubed 

47
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,099
WT times DWT

48
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,239
plus T cubed times, and we simplify the

49
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,200
WT times, DWT will be equal to DT.

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,560
Hence, we get a standard form for an

51
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,900
Ito process. We get 3T squared WT

52
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,459
squared plus T cube times DT

53
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,980
Plus

54
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,280
2T Cube WT times dWt. And this is the

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,280
expression for dXt. Okay, that is DxD.

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,459
And we can recover the full form.

57
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,420
So, if we have this expression for dXt.

58
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,680
Hence, XT itself is equal to sum X0

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,700
plus two integrals. The first integral is

60
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,159
Ito integral, and the second one is

61
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,800
the standard Riemann integral. Okay, so, we

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,980
have integral from 0 to T. I will write

63
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,680
the first one.

64
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,140
Or, maybe, that one, that is more

65
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,400
important for us.

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,760
I will change the variable to a

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,760
new name, so, instead of T, I will use A, U,

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,860
any other letter is okay.

69
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,879
Your cube WUDWU plus ordinary

70
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,299
Riemann integral, integral from 0 to T

71
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,040
3 U squared W

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,120
squared plus U cube

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,260
DU.

74
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,720
And this expression has some useful

75
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,000
properties. For example, I can immediately

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,199
say, whether XD is a Martingale, because I

77
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,060
have

78
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,060
this term

79
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,199
and the second term. The first term 

80
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,380
is a martingale, X0 is a constant, but I

81
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,780
have one more term. So, I may immediately

82
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,400
conclude, that my XT is not a martingale.

83
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,060
Okay, let's move on to DSD.

84
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,440
All right,

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,400
we use the same Ito's lemma, and we have

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
dYt.

87
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,560
There are no T inside ST squared, so, we

88
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,460
just will take the second term of Ito's lemma

89
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,940
and the third one. Okay, so, the

90
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,720
first derivative with respect to ST is

91
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,220
2 ST times DST. Okay, I take the second

92
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,520
derivative plus one over two times

93
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,139
2 times DST

94
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,000
squared.

95
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,820
Okay, I plug in the value for DST, I know,


98
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,639
that DST is equal to M ST DT

99
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,860
plus sigma STDWT. That's the

100
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,259
expression for DST in the Black and Scholes

101
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,300
model. 

102
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,960
And here I have a MSTDT plus sigma S

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,600
TDWT squared.

105
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,060
Inside these brackets I see, that

106
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,780
DT squared will be equal to zero DWT

107
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,919
times DWT will be DT, and DWT times DT

108
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,699
will be zero. Okay, so,

110
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,979
I have 2 MST squared DT plus 2 sigma ST

112
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,759
squared times DWT plus. Everything will

113
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,460
disappear, except one term. One term will

114
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,039
remain. It will be sigma squared

115
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,419
times ST squared times DT.

116
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,520
This is just 

117
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,919
DWT squared.

118
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,860
Okay, and I have the short expression for

119
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,539
dYt.

121
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,039
And I might write the full form for dYt.

122
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,300
That means YT equals to Y0 Plus

123
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,280
stick a stochastic integral

124
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,840
from zero to D. Where is the stochastic

125
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,259
part? Stochastic part is here.

126
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,500
It is two sigma SU squared times dWu

127
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,400
Plus,

128
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,520
and I have ordinary integral from 0 to T.

129
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Everything else is ordinary Riemann

130
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,460
integral. So, I will have a 2 MSU

131
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:52,080
squared plus sigma squared SU

132
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,419
squared times

133
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,080
DDU.

134
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,020
And this full form gives me some

135
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,960
properties of YT. Once again, I can

136
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,080
immediately check whether my YT is a

137
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,680
martingale. I have a constant, I have

138
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,780
stochastic integral, which is a

139
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,479
martingale, and I have some

140
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,780
other terms. And, hence, I conclude once

141
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,759
again, that my process YT is not a

142
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,500
martingale.


144
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,419
Hence, just have applied Ito's lemma twice, and we see, that basically it's

145
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,779
easy. It's a little bit more complex, than

146
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,200
the usual derivative. We need to take

147
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,620
the derivative twice, but, except this

148
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,200
small correction term, everything is easy,

149
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,339
and is as usual in ordinary calculus.
