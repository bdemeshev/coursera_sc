3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,540
In this video we will introduce Girsanov theorem. First, we will start with appealing, but

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,719
wrong answer to the pricing problem.

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,179
Then we will introduce the idea of

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,660
alternative probability and then, finally,

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,220
we will state the Girsanov theorem.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,180
First, let's provide the wrong intuition.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,180
It seems, that the future payoff XT is

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,059
random. And to calculate the current

11
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,120
price of something, that is random in the

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,340
future, we just need to calculate the

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,219
expected payoff given current

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,940
information. So, it seems at first a

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,820
glance, that X0 should be equal to

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,840
expected value of Xt given initial

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,460
information F0.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,000
But this intuitive idea is wrong.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,559
It will be true for a martingale, but the

20
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:02,820
claim price

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,519
Xt is not a martingale.

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,520
So, that's the main idea, why this answer

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,260
is wrong.

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,960
We will modify it to make it correct.
2
25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,180
First, let's introduce the idea of

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,000
alternative probability. Normally in

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,240
probability of statistics we work with

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,759
just one probability. There is only one

29
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,159
true probability P.

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,700
In the Black and Scholes model it's very

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,680
useful to introduce alternative

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,579
probability P star. So, we will have two

34
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,920
probabilities: probability P and

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,380
probability P star. Imagine the following.

36
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,320
A simple example: the random variable X

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,439
takes three values either minus two,

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,259
either zero, either four. And we have

39
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,960
probability P.

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,420
The probability P, that X is equal to

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,320
minus 2 is 0 3, but the probability P

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,759
star, that X is equal to -2 is 0 4. So,

43
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,500
they are different.

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,258
And we can calculate different expected

45
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,400
values.

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,599
For example, expected value of X is 0 6.

47
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,000
You just multiply value by probability

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,180
and you add. And the expected value star,

49
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,360
the expected value calculating, using

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,879
alternative probability is different, is

51
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,739
one over two, because the probability is

52
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,500
different. So, we will work with two

53
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,080
probabilities now. And we need to pay

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,660
attention: there will be expected value

55
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,060
and expected value star, and they will be

56
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,980
different.

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,640
The main reason to introduce the

58
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,800
new probability P star in the Black and

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,260
Scholes model is to simplify the

60
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,080
calculation of prices.

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,180
And, finally, we are ready to state the

62
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,540
Girsanov theorem. If Wt is a Wienner process

63
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,620
and the probability P, and WT star is a

64
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,200
Brownian motion with drift, that means it

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,099
is equal to B times t plus Wt. Then there

66
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,640
is a probability P star such, that Wt

67
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,420
star is a Wiener process on the P star.

68
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,019
So, that means sWt is a Wiener process,

69
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,900
it's expected value is zero.

70
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,920
And expected value of Wt star, because we

71
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,760
add B times T inside expected value. So,

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,540
we get B times T, but if I change

73
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,260
probability, if I change expected value

74
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,840
to expected value star, I will get

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,280
expected value star of W star is zero,

76
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,459
because under probability measure P star

77
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:53,180
W star is once again a Wiener process.

78
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,040
We can state Girsanov theorem applied

79
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,680
specially for Black and Scholes model. And

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,080
the Black and Scholes model, there is an

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,959
alternative probability P star such, that

82
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,540
Wt star is a Wiener process on the P

83
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,860
star. And St is equal to S0 times

84
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,798
exponent of R

85
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,019
minus sigma squared over 2 times T

86
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,160
plus sigma times Wt star.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,300
The old formula is still valid as T is

88
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,580
as 0 times exponent

89
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,280
mu minus sigma squared over 2 plus

90
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,000
sigma times Wt. Where Wt is a Wiener

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,880
process and the probability P. So, both

92
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,919
forms are okay.

93
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,300
Let's find a link between Wt and Wt star.

94
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,919
As formulas equivalent we can derive,

95
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,900
that mu minus sigma squared of 2

96
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,440
times T plus sigma times Wt is equal to

97
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,320
R minus sigma squared over 2 times T

98
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,860
plus sigma Wt star. We simplify a little

99
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,440
bit. We can get rid of sigma squared

100
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,240
over 2. And we get, that mu minus R times

101
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,139
T plus sigma times Wt, Wt is the Wiener

102
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,740
process on the P is equal to sigma times

103
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,100
Wd star, that is a Wiener process under

104
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,100
probability P star. Or we may write the

105
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,440
same equation in a short form, we just

106
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,620
add D everywhere, so, we have mu minus R

107
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,979
times Dt plus sigma times dWt is equal

108
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:39,199
to sigma times dWt star.

109
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,820
The meaning of probabilities is the

110
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,900
following P is a real world probability.

111
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,560
It determines, how the future will happen.

112
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,960
And P star is an artificial probability,

113
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,900
that is used to simplify formulas.

114
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,560
We have seen, that big expression with

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,419
dWt is equivalent to a small expression

116
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,940
with WT star, and that's the reason to

117
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,979
introduce the probability measure P star.

118
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,440
Let's make a small summary.

119
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,960
First point fair price of a financial

120
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,660
claim is not a simple expected value,

121
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,580
it's a little bit more difficult to

122
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,199
calculate.

123
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,440
And Girsanov theorem gives two equivalent

124
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,180
formulas for St. St is a zero times

125
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,360
exponent R minus sigma squared of 2

126
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,800
times T plus sigma times Wt star. Or the

127
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,979
same expression with R replaced by mu

128
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:44,400
and the sigma, and the WT star by WT.

129
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,100
And, once again, Wd star is a Wiener

130
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,500
process on the artificial probability P

131
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,860
star. And the big expression mu minus R

132
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,300
Dt plus sigma dWt is a very small

133
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:05,639
sigma times dWt star in this mu terms.

134
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,740
So, basically, that's the reason to

135
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,780
introduce new probability measure to

136
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,979
simplify X position.
