3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:07,259
Welcome to our course on stochastic

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,340
calculus.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,139
This lecture we will discuss Wiener

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,900
process and Martin Gales. And we start

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,379
with a short description of our course.

8
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:19,320
Our main goal is to price European type

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,720
options in the framework of Black 

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,220
and Scholes model. 

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,619
The main problem is a contradiction. Our

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,380
course is very short only four weeks. And

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,480
the mathematics behind the course is

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,439
very hard.

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,820
SoÐ± we will provide sometimes informal

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,760
definitions and theorems. And we will

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,739
focus on problem solving and computer

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,200
simulations in Python.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,800
Okay, Wiener process here it is.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,320
And what is the formal definition behind.

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,140
First, we start with stochastic or random

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,600
process is basically a collection of

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,520
random variable indexed by a time

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,640
variable T. Mainly, we will work in

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,180
continuous time, so, XT the index T will

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,420
belong to any to the set of any positive

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,580
real numbers or zero.

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,700
And sometimes we will work in discrete

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,799
time. So, T maybe, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on. 

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,159
And just a small notation remark:  when we

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,700
write brackets XT, and T greater or

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,580
equal to zero or just bracket 6T, we mean

33
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,640
a collection of random variables. And

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,700
when we write just XT without brackets,

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,740
we mean one a particular random variable.

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,979
Okay, now the Wiener process. The Wiener

37
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,880
process is defined by four  defining

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,540
properties. The first one is very easy. W0

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,600
is zero. So Brownian motion or Wiener

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,320
process starts at zero. The next property

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,799
is more interesting. The increments so WT

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,700
minus WS, the change of Wiener process, is

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,500
a normally distributed random variable

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,720
with mean zero and variance T minus S.

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,260
The third property that increment WT

46
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,500
minus WS is independent of the past

47
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,080
values of Wiener process.

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,200
And the last property. The trajectory of

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,180
Wiener process is continuous with

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,920
probability one.

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,700
So you may see a duck here. This is a

52
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,080
formal duck with a tie and a hat. So this

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,819
definition is perfectly rigorous. And

54
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,700
sometimes we will use less formal

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,760
definitions and you will see the less

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,260
formal duck.

57
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,260
Sometimes, later.

58
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,660
Okay. And here we will use our first

59
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,720
tradition. When we speak about two

60
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,840
arbitrary moments of time SNT, we usually

61
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,019
will suppose that S is before T. As in

62
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,660
the alphabet S is before T. So time

63
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,319
moment S is Before Time moment T.

64
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,500
Our main trick to study properties of

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
many stochastic processes will be divide

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,879
and concur.

67
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,459
That means future value of some process

68
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,980
will be known current Value Plus

69
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,560
unpredictable future change.

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,379
for the Brownian motion it seems trivial.

71
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,819
WT is past value WS plus the Change Plus

72
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,819
WT minus WS.

73
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,180
Okay. Our first exercise with exercise we

74
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,879
need to struggle. So we need a good

75
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,580
helmet and a sword.

76
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,799
Okay. Let's calculate the probability.

77
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,860
That W at time moment 10 is greater than

78
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,900
2 given. That you know some information

79
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,860
that W6 is 3.

80
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,860
Okay. the probability that W10 is greater

81
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,319
than 2 given our information is the

82
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,379
probability. We use our main trick. We

83
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,620
decompose future value into past value

84
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,239
and change. So that will be W6 plus

85
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,239
change W10 minus W6.

86
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,399
Okay. We may use the fact that W6 is 3

87
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,000
and we plug in it instead of W6.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,500
Then we use the fact that W6 now gives

89
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,960
no information about the future change.

90
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,639
And we are done. W10 minus W6. According

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,460
to the defining properties of Brownian

92
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,500
motion is normally distributed with mean

93
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,560
0 and variance 4. Hence we standardize

94
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,380
it. We subtract 0 we divide by square

95
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,600
root of variance, we obtain standard

96
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,880
normal, random, variable.

97 
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,300
And we use standard normal distribution

98
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,340
function f of U that is just the

99
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,440
probability that a standard normal

100
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,460
random variable Z is less or equal to U.

101
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,360
And hence our answer is just the

102
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,919
probability.

103
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,360
That is less than zero five. So it's

104
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,060
a probability distribution function at

105
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,180
0.05. And approximately using tables or

106
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,740
using computer, we can see that it's 0.69.

107
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,440
We will have a lot of gentlemen's

108
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,900
agreement to shorten the X position on

109
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,560
slides. So sS and T are arbitrary two Time

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,220
moments with S before T.

111
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,580
Wt will always denote a Wiener process

112
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,320
that will always denote a standard

113
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,479
normal random variable.

114
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,720
And F of U will denote the standard

115
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,539
normal distribution function.

116
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay. Let's focus a little bit on the

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,220
property of independent increments.

118
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,300
Increment WT minus WS is independent of

119
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,580
the past values.

120
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,580
So W6 minus W4 is independent of W4

121
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,440
w3w1 and so on.

122
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,160
Or W6 minus W4 is independent of these

123
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,539
two increments.

124
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,000
And by the same argument we see that all

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,300
increments W6 minus W 4, W 4 minus W 3

126
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,580
and W 2.5 minus W1 are independent.

127
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,900
Or in more abstract notation if we have

128
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,819
many time intervals that are

129
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,220
non-overlapping.

130
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,300
Then the increments WT1 minus WS1 and so

131
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,400
on are independent.

132
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,340
Just a small remark. The right border of

133
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,039
an interval may touch the left border of

134
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,060
the next one, but it may not exceed it. In

135
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,100
this case of non-overlapping time

136
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,440
intervals the increments of Wiener

137
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,860
process are independent.

138
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,800
Let's calculate expected value and the

139
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,460
variance of a Wiener process.

140
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,139
Expected value of WT is expected value

141
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,800
of WT minus W0 is zero. The variance of

142
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,419
WT is variance of WT minus w0 is T by

143
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,340
the assumptions.

144
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,060
And for T greater than S covariance of

145
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,479
WS WT we use the same trick we decompose

146
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,580
the future value into

147
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,360
past value and future change, and hence

148
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,539
we see that the covariance is just the

149
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:35,460
 the value of s that is before t.

150
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,419
For example covariance of W7 and W3 is

151
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,400
3.

152
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,220
Okay. We have two close friends of Wiener

153
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,599
process.

154
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,880
Brownian motion or winner process

155
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,460
with drift and scaling. When we multiply

156
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,699
winner process WT by some constant a and

157
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,419
when we add a trend B times T. We have a

158
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,520
stochastic process that is called

159
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,580
Brownian motion with drift and scaling.

160
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,660
And one more friend. If we take the

161
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,120
exponent of Brownian motion with drift,

162
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,419
we obtain a very usable stochastic

163
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,940
process that is called geometric bronial

164
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,900
motion.

165
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,539
In the framework of black and souls

166
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,660
model the share price is assumed to

167
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,539
follow geometric Brownian motion, so this

168
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,319
is a model of a price of a share. 

169
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,419
Okay, here we see on the plots of these

170
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,219
two friends of Wiener process.

171
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,559
Okay, just more exercising, let's

172
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,719
calculate expected value of Brownian

173
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,820
motion with drift and scaling. Expected

174
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,060
value of 5 WT plus 60 and the variance

175
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,860
of the same process.

176
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,860
Okay, that's very easy expected value of

177
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,300
5wg plus 60 is 0 Plus 60. And the

178
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,860
variance of 5wt plus 60 is just 25 T,

179
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,800
because 60 does not influence the

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,220
variance.

181
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,940
Okay, sometimes to calculate harder

182
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,120
properties of Wiener processes and

183
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,220
the friends of Wiener processes, we will

184
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,399
need expected values of exponents. We

185
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,440
will just postulate them, that the

186
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,740
expected value of exponent of a z is

187
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,279
exponent of a square root of 2. And the

188
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,260
same property holds not only for

189
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,360
standardized 

190
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,420
random variables Z, that  is normal 0 1

191
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,980
but for arbitrary WT.

192
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,720
these properties are obtained using

193
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,959
integration but we will not go into

194
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,540
details, but basically one needs to

195
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,459
calculate the integral of the function

196
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,160
times the probability density function

197
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,180
of the corresponding random variable.

198
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,380
and the expected value of exponent of ax

199
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,140
is so useful, that it has its own name

200
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,500
moment generating function.

201
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,180
for example, moment generating function

202
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,940
for a standard normal random variable is

203
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,680
exponent of a squared over 2.

204
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,019
why may we need a moment generating

205
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,100
function?

206
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,160
 if you can take the derivative of a

207
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,980
moment generating function  with

208
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,800
respect to the variable

209
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,660
u. you will have expected value of x

210
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,320
times exponent of u x and if you plug in

211
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,380
the value 0 instead of U you will obtain

212
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,279
just expected value of x. if you repeat

213
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,440
this trick many times you see that

214
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,480
moment generating function is a funny

215
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,700
way to calculate a lot of expected

216
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,920
values. for example you take the

217
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,680
derivative twice and you get expected

218
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,399
value of x squared you calculate the

219
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,740
derivative three times and you plug in 0

220
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,500
instead of U and you get expected value

221
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,079
of x cubed and it's very useful to

222
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,140
calculate many expected value and to

223
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,980
study properties of stochastic processes.

224
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,160
so, a short summary: what is a

225
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,800
Wiener process? Wiener process is a

226
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,899
stochastic process with normal and

227
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,120
independent increments.

228
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,000
Wiener process with drift and geometric

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,820
Wiener processes are two friends of a

230
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,519
Wiener process. and the share price in

231
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,100
the black controls model is modeled by

232
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,959
the geometric Wiener process by

233
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,000
geometric Brownian motion.

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,220
and we have introduced moment generating

235
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,380
function that is used to calculate

236
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,579
expected values.

237
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,980
