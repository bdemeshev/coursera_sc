3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,959
Now let's solve some real models.

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,720
Let's consider Vasicek interest rate

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,380
model. DRT is equal to 005
6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,220
minus RT times DT plus 2 times WT. That's

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,680
a very simple model for interest rate,

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,779
that it's non-constant interest rate,

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,240
even stochastic interest rate, it changes

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,840
randomly over time. And let's solve for

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,599
it's expected value. Basically, what does

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,600
this model mean? This model means, that, if

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,380
RT is too big, is bigger, than 0 0 5, then

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,620
this term will be negative. So, there will

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,120
be a tendency to go down for RT, and

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,660
these terms to DWT, basically, intuitively

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,379
means, that is the source of randomness.

18
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,140
Okay, let's calculate expected value of

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,219
RT.

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,800
First step, we will recover full form

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,000
corresponding to this short form

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,900
notation. So, let's write full form first.

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,439
RTE is basically R0 plus, we transform

24
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,380
this expression into full form. Basically,

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,799
we replace T by some, as a letter by U,

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,380
and we write integrals. So, we write

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,200
integral from 0 to T

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,220
0 0 5 minus RU

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,500
DU plus

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,220
integral from 0 to T2 times dWu.

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,920
Okay, let's simplify, and let's take

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,200
expected value.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,000
So, R0 is given,  this integral we

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,479
already know, that there are no, so, there

35
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,280
are, basically, two trading points we

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,619
should buy at time moment zero and sell

37
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,079
it time moment two, two shares with price

38
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,320
governed by WU.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,420
And, hence,

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,399
this term equals 2 times 2

41
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,758
WT, that's our final value of the

42
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,540
portfolio minus 2 times W0.

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,900
And, hence, our 

44
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,400
RT equals to 0 0 7 plus integral from 0

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,840
to t 0 0 5 minus RUDU plus 2 times WT.

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,700
And, so, RT is stochastic. And let's take

47
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,620
expected value.

48
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,560
So, I take expected value of RT, I get 0 0

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,760
7 plus.

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,379


51
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,640
When I have an ordinary Riemann integral,

52
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,000
expected value just goes inside ordinary

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,599
integral. So, it will be  integral from

54
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,140
0 to T expected value of 0 0 5 minus RUDU

55
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,860
plus expected value of Wiener

56
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,040
process is zero.

57
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,760
So, I get an interesting equation.

58
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,659
Expected value of RT is 0 0 7 plus

59
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:20,400
integral from 0 to t 0 0 5 minus

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,840
expected value of RUDU.

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,620
And for simplicity, let's denote this

62
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,739
function by some H by some

63
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,980
M of t.

64
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,920
Okay, we have M of T, that's a

65
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,260
deterministic function, because it's an

66
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,319
expected value. It is 0 0 7 plus

67
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,239
integral from 0 to T 0 0 5 minus M of

68
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,500
UDU.

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,580
Let's take the derivative.

70
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,599
M prime

71
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,540
is, we take the derivative with respect

72
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,500
to T. So, 0 0 7 will be transformed into

73
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,580
zero.

74
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,519
And, hence, I have a very interesting case.

75
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,599
I integrate from 0 to T, and I take the

76
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,180
derivative. If I take integral, then

77
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,120
derivative basically nothing happens, and

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,238
I just write the expression inside. I

79
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,500
have

80
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,840
the following fact, that if you

81
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,440
integrate from 0 to T, any deterministic

82
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,460
function H of UDU, and you take the

83
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,479
derivative after it. So, you have nothing

84
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,680
to do. You can just be lazy, and you will

85
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,660
not take integral, will not take the

86
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,440
derivative, and it will be just H of T.

87
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,020
Okay, in our case, that will be 0 or

88
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,520
0 5 minus

89
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,259
M of T.

90
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,479
Now we will solve our ordinary

91
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,780
differential equation. Let's move on.

92
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,520
We get the equation M or prime

93
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,960
equals to 0 0 5 minus M, where MT

94
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,220
is a non-random function. Okay, let's

95
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:24,539
write, DUTDT equals to 0 0 5 minus MTI

96
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,539
separate variables. So, I will move

97
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,720
the function M to the left hand side, T

98
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,639
to the right hand side. I will get D MT

99
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,900
divided by 0 0 5 times MT equals to DT.

100
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,139
I add the magic sign - 

101
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,699
the integral.

102
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,300
And I just calculate this integral. I get

103
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,680
a logarithm of absolute value of 0 0 5

104
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,340
minus M t with minus, because I have

105
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,940
minus MT equals to T plus some

106
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,620
constant C0.

107
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,759
Now I multiply by -1. I get,

108
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,660

109
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,560
and I will take exponents, so, I will got

110
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,880
absolute value of 0 0 5 minus M T is

111
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,759
equal to

112
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,919
exponent of minus T times exponent of

113
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,440
minus C0.

114
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,960
This will be just another constant C1.

115
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,539
The absolute value of MT minus 0 0 5

116
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,880
is the same thing, as absolute value of

117
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,199
0 0 5 minus MT. So, basically, I can open

118
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,940
the absolute value. And I will get MT

119
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,960
minus 0 0 5

120
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,800
equals to

121
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,419
exponent of minus T times plus or minus

122
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,699
C1, depending, whether, we open the

123
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,759
absolute value is minus, so, plus. Okay,

124
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,880
this is just another constant C2. It is

125
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
not evolving in time.

126
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
And I have initial condition: my

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,780
initial condition is R0 is equal to 0 0

128
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,280
7. Okay, if initial condition is 0 0 7,

129
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,880
then I can calculate this C2. 0 0 7 minus

130
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,180
0 0 5 equals to exponent of

131
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,060
minus 0 times C2.

132
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,800
Hence, C2 is just 0 0 2.

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,020
And I got my final

134
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,440
answer. I just plug in C2 in my previous

135
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,580
answer, and I got the final expression. mu

136
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,500
T the expected value of RT equals to

137
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,080
0 0 5 plus

138
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,759
0 0 2 times exponent of minus T.

139
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,099
And let's draw this function, let's draw

140
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,410
this expected value to fill it better.

141
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,439

142
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:23,099
This is T. This is MT. And the starting

143
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,580
value R0

144
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,400
is 0 0 7.

145
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,679
And, then, when T goes up, this term goes

146
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,479
to zero.

147
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,820
So, eventually,

148
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,940
my function will tend to 0 0 5.

149
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,760
And do not forget, that, that's only

150
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,940
expected value of R0, and R0 fluctuates

151
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,420
around this expected value. So,

152
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,740
basically,

153
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,180
the actual random process  will

154
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,339
look like,

155
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,019
it will fluctuate around this

156
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,260
expected value.

157
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,080
That's all we have solved YC check model

158
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,519
at least for expected value of interest

159
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,880
rate.
