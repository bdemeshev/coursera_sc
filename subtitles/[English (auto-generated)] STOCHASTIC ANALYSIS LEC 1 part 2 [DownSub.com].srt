3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,080
Our course is about problem solving, so, let's solve

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,120
some problems. Let's calculate expected

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,340
value variance and covariance. let's

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,380
calculate expected variance of T times

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,859
WT, where WT is a Wiener process power

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,060
four. Okay. As t is non-random, we just take

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,439
it out.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,640
And is T expected value of WT power 4.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
Next we will standardize our random

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,880
variable WT power 4. So, we use the fact

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,399
that

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,579
WT has the same distribution, as square

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,120
root of T times standard  random,

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,640
variable normal standard print, variable

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,200
Z.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,059
And if I will do this

19
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:52,739
substitution, the distribution will not

20
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,539
change and the expected value will not

21
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,760
change. So, I will get T times expected

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,339
value of square root T times Z power 4.

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,420
As T is non-random, I will take squared

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,720
T squared out of the brackets. That's T

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,479
times T squared times expected value of

26
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,340
Z power 4. Now I see that that power 4

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,979
is a power of a standard normal random

28
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,240
variable, so I can use the effect which

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,520
can be established, using integration or

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,979
some other tricks. That expected value of

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,360
ZN.

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,900
For even N is N minus 1, times N minus 3,

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,960
times N minus all.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,340
Odd numbers Q1. In my case it will be

35
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,380
T cube times 4 minus 1 is 3. I

36
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,040
subtract two more is one, and voila.

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,479
So we get 3 times T cubed.

38
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,240
Now let's move on to the calculation of

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,840
variance.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,439
We need to calculate variance of T times

41
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,760
WT power 4 plus T squared. First, we use

42
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,879
the property of variance that we can add

43
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,140
constants non-random quantities for free.

44
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,860
So we just get variance of T times WT

45
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,180
power 4 plus nothing. Okay, we take out T,

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,000
but now with square.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,840
We get T squared times variance of WT

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,620
power 4.

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,680
Now  we will do once again the same

50
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,519
substitution, we will say that WT has the

51
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,860
same distribution as square root of T

52
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,860
times some standard normal random

53
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,200
variable. And hence using this

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,140
substitution, we get tT squared times

55
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,360
variance of square root of T times Z

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,940
power 4.

57
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,860
That is equal.

58
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,860
Now I have  T squared inside brackets,

59
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,599
but it will go out with one more square.

60
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,860
So, I get T squared times T squared

61
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,720
squared times variance of that

62
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,580
power 4.

63
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,300
And I get T power 6.

64
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,620
And now I get expected value of Z power

65
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,200
8 minus expected value of Z power 4

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,720
squared. I have used the definition of

67
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,700
variance. And then I get T power 6

68
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,620
and I use the moment formula for normal

69
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,159
standard random variable. And hence, I

70
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:03,599
have 7 times 5 times 3 times 1 minus

71
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,019
three times one

72
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,180
squared.

73
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,540
And finally, I get T power 6 times

74
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,440
seven times three, it will be 21, 105

75
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,660
minus 9.

76
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,940
And hence, we have calculated variance.

77
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,979
And now let's move to covariance.

78
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,600
Usually we will consider two moments

79
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,000
of time SNT and for simplicity we will

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,080
make an agreement that S is less than T.

81
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,259
Let's calculate covariance.

82
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:45,600
Covariance of T times WT with WS squared

83
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,360
is equal. According to the definition of

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,240
covariance, it's expected value of the

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,500
product T times, WT times, WS squared

86
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,660
minus

87
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,139
the product of  expected value.

88
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,960
Expected value of T times WT times

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,560
expected value of WS squared.

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,060
Okay.

91
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,479
First, let's make some simple remarks.

92
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,620
Here we can move T outside. And expected

93
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,720
value of WT is zero, so we will ignore

94
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,600
the second term. And let's focus on

95
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,479
the first one. Here we move T once again

96
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,160
out of the brackets. And we get T

97
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,720
times expected value of WT times WS

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,220
squared.

99
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,080
And here we have  two correlated  or

100
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,900
probably dependent variables.

101
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,100
And we need to be careful here,

102
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,320
because these variables,

103
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,660
they may be dependent.

104
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,500
And so let's use our standard trick. We

105
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,960
will represent future value, as past

106
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,780
value plus some  unpredictable

107
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,400
independent increment. So, we will replace

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,960
WT with past value WS plus independent

109
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,940
increment. So, plus WT minus WS that is it

110
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,720
future value.

111
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,900
This is plus value

112
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,360
plus increment.

113
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,880
That's our standard trick.

114
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,240
Let's see what we will have. We will have

115
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,020
T times expected value of Ws plus Wt

116
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,479
minus Ws

117
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,300
times Ws squared.

118
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,460
We are almost done. We have T times

119
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,000
expected value of Ws cubed.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,139
That is 0, because it's a odd moment of

121
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,539
 scaled standard normal random

122
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:13,520
variable.

123
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,400
Plus T times expected value of

124
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,979
WT minus Ws times Ws squared. And hence

125
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:32,520
we. Here we know that WT minus Ws and

126
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,120
WS are independent.

127
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,660
Here we have independency. So, we may

128
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,539
decompose our expected value into a

129
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,039
product of expected values.

130
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,419
So, we have a T times expected value of

131
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:56,460
WT minus WS times expected value of WS

132
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,220
squared.

133
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,800
From the definition of Wiener process of

134
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,880
Brownian motion, we know that WT minus WS

135
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,060
has normal distribution with mean 0 and

136
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,720
variance T minus S. And hence, this

137
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,680
expected value is 0, because of the first

138
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,460
term.

139
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,060
And even more, let's calculate some easy

140
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,580
probability. Let's calculate probability

141
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,060
of

142
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:36,958
3 times W 4 minus W 3 greater than zero.

143
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,418
Let's calculate this probability.

144
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,420
As we have a linear combination of

145
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,360
values of Wiener process, we know, that

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,580
this random variable has normal

147
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,120
distribution. So, this variable has normal

148
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,880
distribution with some mean

149
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
and some variance.

150
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,380
But what is the mean of this linear

151
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,940
combination expected value of 3 times W

152
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,720
4 minus W 3 is 3 times 0 minus 0 is 0.

153
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,880
And honestly speakingб I don't care about

154
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,440
the variance.

155
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,300
I have the probability that 

156
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,440


157
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
normal distribution with mean 0 and some

158
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,080
variance is greater than zero.

159
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,560
Soб it's probability that some normal

160
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,839
variable with mean 0 and some variance

161
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,899
is greater than zero, but due to the

162
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,360
symmetry of this normal variable around

163
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,480
zero, I get one point.

164
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,440
One over two
