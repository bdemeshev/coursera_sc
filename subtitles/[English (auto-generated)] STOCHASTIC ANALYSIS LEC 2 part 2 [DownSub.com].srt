3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,740
Stochastic intergrals play important role in the Black

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,380
and Scholes model. So, let's calculate our

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,080
two first stochastic integrals.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,460
Okay, so, what  is the meaning,

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,039
intuitive meaning of stochastic integral?

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,939
we treat this quantity,

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,640
as the profit of an investor, who has XU

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,020
shares, and the price of a share is WU.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,579


12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,260
Now we have this, let's call it Financial

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,660
strategy,

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,879
I'm not speaking about its optimality

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,660
let's just consider it as given. so we

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,920
have a

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,899
full trading points. let's draw them on

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,399
timeline.

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,960
we have starting moment zero. we have a

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,920
jump at moment one, so there will be a

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,979
transaction at moment one. there will be

22
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,700
also a transaction at moment four and

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,200
the final moment of time is five we will

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
sell our portfolio.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,040
okay at time moment zero,

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,979
we should have three shares. so we should

27
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,740
buy that is our first

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,580
transaction. we should buy three shares

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,840
and the price is w0.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,479
okay at time Moment One

31
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,780
we already have three shares but

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,240
according to our strategy we should have

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,240
from point one to point four we should

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,979
have W1 Square shares. so so we we should

35
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,680
additionally Buy

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,820
 W1 squared minus three. we already

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,180
have three shares. so We additionally buy

38
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,299
the quantity we would like to have minus

39
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,500
the quantity we already have shares.

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,239
Given,

41
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,940


42
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,780
that the price is  W1

43
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,760
at that moment four,

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,660
we have one more  transaction, we

45
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,660
additionally buy. Let's calculate, how

46
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,720
many before time moment four we have W1

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,660
squared, shares after moment four, we

48
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,260
should have W two square root shares, so,

49
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,379
we additionally buy W2 square root minus

50
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,879
W1 squared shares,

51
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,140
and their price is W4.

52
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,800
And, finally, we sell everything at time

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,280
moment five, we sell the portfolio, we

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,140
have.

55
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:03,860

So, we sell W2 square shares,

56
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,420
and the price of each share is W5. Okay,

57
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,760
let's calculate our profit, and this

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,739
profit will be the value of our

59
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,860
stochastic integral. So, let's write

60
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,519
all, we should spend with minus, and all

61
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,440
we should receive is plus, that's

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,080
basically the value of an integral. So, we

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,940
get minus three times W0 quantity times

64
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,140
price minus W1 square root minus three

65
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,959
times W1

66
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,300

67
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,780
minus W2 minus W1 squared times W4,

68
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,080
and here we sell. So, we receive money, we

69
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,420
get plus W2 squared times W5, so, that's

70
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,500
the value of our stochastic integral.

71
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,440
Once again, I'm not pretending, that we

72
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,840
are actually buying, maybe, this quantity

73
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,819
is negative, so, we are selling in

74
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,060
this case, and, hence,  this value will

75
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,819
be  with plus, but that's completely

76
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,820
okay. This formula will take care of,

77
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,639
whether we buy, whether we sell, so, that's

78
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,800
a final result.

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,060
Okay, and what about the other integral?

80
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,380
Let's consider it  in more details

81
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,820
integral from 0 to 5, to WU plus three

82
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,040
dWu.

83
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,340
In this case we are doing transaction at

84
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,080
every moment of time.

85
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,780
So, we're doing transaction infinitely

86
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,479
many times, and we should consider some

87
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,419
limiting, some sense,

88
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,639
if we are doing rigorous mass, but we

89
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,280
will just use a table of integrals and

90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,320
the properties of stochastic integrals.

91
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,860
They are linear, so, we get two

92
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,919
integrals from zero to five W dWu plus

93
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,240
integral from 0 to 5 3dWu.

94
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,100
And, basically, this integral is in our

95
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,900
table. So, we will get 2 times

96
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,380
W5 squared minus

97
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,419
five

98
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:28,919
over two

99
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,660
plus. And this one we may calculate it in

100
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,500
intuitively, we should buy at the initial

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,860
moment of time three shares, and we will

102
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,160
sell them at the final moment of time. So,

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,940
we should buy minus 3 times W0, and we

104
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,340
should sell them at the final moment of

105
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,000
time, so, we will get three the number of

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,520
shares, times the share price W5.

107
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,520
So, this is the value of our second

108
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,840
stochastic integral.

109
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,340
