[Music]

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,599
Okay, so, let's consider the process XT

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,020
equals to WG squared plus alpha T. And

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,520
let's

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,100
find out, when it's a martingale,

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,859
because martingales are useful in

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,359
pricing options.

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,098
Okay, what is a short form for dXt? We use Ito's lemma.

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,920 
We say: wow! We need to take

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,559
the derivative with respect to T, that is

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,680
alpha times DT plus. We need to take

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,020
derivative with respect to WT, because

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,899
it's the unique stochastic process, we

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,260
have in the right hand side. So, it will

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,920
be 2 times WT times dWt plus. In Ito's lemma

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,559
we have additional correction

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,660
term.

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,840
And, hence, we will have 1 over 2 times

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
second derivative with respect to WT. It

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,000
will be 2

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,180
times. We will have, hence, here DWT

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,900
squared. Okay, let's simplify. DWT

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,960
according to our symbolic algebra is

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,759
just DT.

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:32,040
Hence, we get alpha DT plus 2 WTDWT

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,540
plus, and we have one times DT.

28
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,780
Okay, let's rewrite the short form.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,200
We have dXt is just equal to alpha

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,060
plus one

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,740
DT

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,200
plus 2 WTDWT.

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,840
If we recover the full form

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,740
corresponding to this short form,
,
35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,780
we will get XT equals to X0 plus

36
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,500
integral from 0 to T alpha plus 1 DU

37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,379
plus integral from 0 to T

38
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,300
to WUDWU.

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,319
And we know, that this is a constant.

40
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,500
We may even found find out, that X0 is W0

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,340
squared plus alpha times zero. This is

42
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,400
honestly zero.

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,840
This is a martingale.

44
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,879
A constant plus a martingale is a

45
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,980
martingale, but this term

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,500
in general is not a martingale. But we

47
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,680
see, that when alpha is equal to

48
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,580
-1, this term will be killed. So, our

49
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,500
answer, that XT is a martingale,

50
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,739
if and only if

51
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,599
alpha is -1. Otherwise, these Riemann

52
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,180
ordinary integral will not be zero, and

53
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,360
the XT process will not be a martingale.

54
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,700
And now let's continue with the next

55
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,099
process, let's consider their Y process.

56
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,860
We also need to find out, when YT is a

57
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,019
martingale, and even more we need to find

58
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,780
some expected value. Okay, YT is an

59
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,500
exponent of alpha WT plus beta T, I

60
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
have two parameters here, I'm scared, but

61
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,299
let's do it.

62
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,519
Okay,

63
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:59,400
here our F of T and WT is exponent of

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,640
alpha WT plus beta T.

65
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,239
Okay, let's calculate F prime with

66
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,560
respect to T.

67
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,900
It will be beta times original

68
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,380
exponent alpha WT plus beta T or we may

69
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,639
just shortly write it like beta times

70
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,860
YT.

71
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,360
Okay, let's calculate F prime with

72
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,040
respect to WT. By the same logic, I will

73
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,960
obtain alpha

74
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,180
times exponent of alpha WT plus beta

75
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,759
T or just alpha times YT.

76
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,160
If I take the second derivative with

77
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,060
respect to my stochastic processes,

78
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,900
then I will have F prime prime WTWT

79
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,540
is alpha

80
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,900
times alpha times YT,

81
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,900
by the same logic. Now let's plug in

82
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,960
everything we have found into the Ito's lemma.

84
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:16,040
Okay, we have dYt equals 2

85
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,400
beta YT times DT Plus

86
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,440
alpha 

87
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,320
YT times dWt plus correction term.

88
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,060
1 over 2

89
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,120
times

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,180
alpha squared times YT

91
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,220
times DWT squared.

92
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,020
We remember our symbolic simplification

93
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,940
rules, that DWT times DWT is just DT.

94
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,720
So, I get a very simple expression,

95
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,300
that dYt is just

96
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,680
beta YT

97
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,580
plus 1 over 2 alpha squared YT times DT

98
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,340
plus alpha YT DWT.

99
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,979
That's the expression for dYt.

100
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,979
Let's recover the full form.

101
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,440
Let's look at the full form, what is the

102
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,660
value of YT?

103
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,300
YT is just sum Y0 a constant plus a

104
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,440
martingale.

105
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,100
So, we will have integral from 0 to T

106
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,759
alpha YUDWU plus a term, 

107
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,479
that is not a martingale in general. Plus

108
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,080
Riemann integral from 0 to T

109
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,500
beta y YU plus 1 over 2 alpha squared

110
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,900
YUDU.

112
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,759
That is a constant,

113
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,960
that is a martingale.

114
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,819
And this is probably

115
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,660
the thing, that will

116
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,400
make our YT non-martingale process.

117
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,319
So, how may I get rid of this

118
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,220
Riemann integral? Oh, I need to set up

119
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,560
beta equal to minus 1 over 2 alpha

120
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,919
squared. If I will do like this,



122
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,599
the value inside the integral will be

123
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,479
zero, the integral will be zero, and, hence,

124
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,199
my YT will be a martingale. Hence, this is

125
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,599
the necessary and sufficient condition

126
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,479
to make my process a martingale.

127
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,340
Okay, now let's see, how this 

128
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,220
conclusion may help us to find expected

129
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,639
values.

130
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,000
So, let's find out expected value of

132
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,060
exponent of alpha times WT.

133
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,340
This process is not a martingale, we know it,

135
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,840
but I can make it a Martingale. So, I know

136
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,340
by definition

137
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,879
of a martingale and our calculations,

138
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,679
that the process YT, that is exponent of

139
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,000
alpha times WT minus alpha squared over

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,279
2 times T, this process is a martingale.

141
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,440
But what does it mean - the process is a

142
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,260
martingale? Martingales have many useful

143
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,980
properties, for example, expected value of YT,
145
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,540
given YS

146
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,339
or, whatever,

147
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,519
Y where S,

148
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,320
where YT and YS are two values, and S is

149
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,640
a time moment before T. So, in this case,

150
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,580
expected value of YT given YS is just YS.

151
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,860
In particular,
153
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,040
if I take expected value of both sides

154
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,880
of this expression, I get expected value

155
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,180
of YT for martingales is always equal to

156
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,760
expected value of YS.

157
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,820
So, that's a necessary condition for a

158
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,240
process to be a martingale. So, now I can

159
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,480
easily find the expected value, I wish.

160
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,779
I will use the property of a martingale.

161
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,800
So, I will say, that expected value of YT

162
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,040
is equal to expected value, and here

163
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,040
I may use any value of SS equal to 1S,

164
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,399
equal to 2S, equal to zero. Let's use the

165
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,880
value 0. Okay, the expected value of Y0.

166
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,000
That's guaranteed because YT is a

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,959
martingale.

168
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,899
Okay, but Y0 is exponent of alpha times

169
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,380
0 minus alpha square root over 2 times 0,

170
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,480
and it's 1.

171
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,339
That's a constant.

172
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,480
Okay, so, expected value of exponent of

173
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,040
alpha YT

174
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,459
minus alpha squared over 2T,

175
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,580
is equal to 1, because expected value of

176
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,740
a constant is a constant.

177
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,300
And then I just 

178
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,940
factor the exponential into a product of

179
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,700
two of two terms expected value of

180
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,260
exponent of alpha YT times exponent of

181
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,260
minus alpha squared over 2 times D.

182
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,740
The second quantity is non-random, this

183
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,660
one is non-random.

184
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,860
And I can take it out of the integral.

185
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,720
And, finally, I get, that

186
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,959
expected value of exponent of alpha WT

187
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,360
is, we need to divide one by

188
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,519
exponent of minus Alpha squared over

189
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,320
2 times t.

190
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,000
And,

191
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
it is equal,

192
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,880
let's write our final answer exponent of

193
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,640
alpha squared over 2 times D.

194
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,399
So, we have used a very interesting trick,

195
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,459
we have transformed our process into a

196
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,519
martingale, and then it's easy to

197
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,200
calculate expected values for

198
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,779
martingales and using expected values

199
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,000
for martingales. We have recovered

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,600
expected value of an expression, that was

201
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,980
not a martingale.
