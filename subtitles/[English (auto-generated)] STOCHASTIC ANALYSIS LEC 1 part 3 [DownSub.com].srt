3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,820
In this video we will discuss the concept of conditional expected value. 

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,599
We will start with a sigma algebra,

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,820
or an object to model knowledge to model

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,940
information, then we will discuss a

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,039
conditional expected value and its

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,199
properties, and then we will move on to

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,480
the conditional variance.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,640
Okay, let's start with modeling

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,680
information. Imagine the following

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,500
situation: John knows the value of a

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,280
random variable X. Maria knows the value

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
of a random variable X, and she knows

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,379
more, she knows also the value of random

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,460
variable Y.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,820
So intuitively we understand that Maria

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,420
knows more. But how do describe this

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,940
difference from mathematical viewpoint?

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,760
How to describe this difference in

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,280
knowledge mathematically?

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,280
And, we introduce informally the

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,860
concept of sigma algebra.

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,739
Here we have an informal duck, so this

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,720
definition is a little bit informal, but

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,680
it conveys the intuition right. The sigma

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,260
algebra generated by random variables X.

28
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,740
And Y is a collection of all addends,

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,860
that can be stated in terms of these two

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,420
random variables.

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,860
We denote it by sigma of X and Y. And

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,759
let's discuss an example.  The sigma

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,920
algebra generated by random variables X

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,220
and Y contains all events, that can be

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,619
stated in terms of X and Y. For example, X

36
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,079
is less than five. This event in the

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,799
description uses only the variable X. So,

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,619
it's contained in the sigma algebra. The

39
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,820
avid X greater than 2Y is in this sigma

40
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,960
algebra. The event sine of Y is greater

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,600
than cosine of X, is contained in this

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,840
sigma algebra. So, Sigma algebra is a big,

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,079
big, big, big list of events. There are

44
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,420
really usually, there are infinitely many

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,598
events in a sigma algebra.

46
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,959
And now we can model information. So, John

47
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,080
knows the value of X. So, his sigma

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,800
algebra is generated by X. So, this list

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,780
of events contains all the events of the

50
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,739
type: X is greater than 1, X belongs to

51
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,280
the interval from 7 to 8. Everything that

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,520
can be stated in terms of X.

53
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,459
Mary knows more, so, her sigma algebra has

54
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,400
more evidence inside it.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,280
And basically, in mathematical terms

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,800
the sigma algebra F

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,200
of John is a subset of sigma algebra F

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,040
of Maria.

59
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,940
Let's move on to the concept of

60
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,360
measurability. Sometimes, information

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,400
contained in a sigma algebra is enough

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,019
to calculate

63
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,660
the value of some random variable. For

64
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,640
example, if you have enough information

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,239
to calculate the value of R of a random

66
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,940
variable R, we say, that random variable R

67
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,980
is measurable with respect to sigma

68
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,560
algebra F. And here's definition is more

69
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,019
or less formal. So, sigma algebra

70
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,840
generated by R. So, knowledge

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,980
to find R, to find out R, is less than

72
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,379
your knowledge F. Knowledge is a list of

73
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,860
all events you know.

74
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,580
We say once again that sigma R is a

75
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,879
subset of sigma algebra F, that means in

76
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,700
plain wards that information in F, is

77
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,860
sufficient to calculate the value of R,

78
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,739
but maybe you know more random variables,

79
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,239
maybe you know some other random

80
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,920
variables as well.

81
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,400
And we have informal CRM. If a random

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,280
variable R is measurable with respect to

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,220
sigma algebra generated by X and Y,

84
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,879
then it can be represented as a

85
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,299
deterministic function of X and Y.

86
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,860
So, if a knowledge contained in X and Y

87
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,580
is enough to find out R, that means R can

88
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,979
be calculated as a function of X and Y.

89
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,180
And now let's move on to the main

90
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,240
concept of this block. The best

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,880
prediction of a random variable R given

92
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680
Sigma algebra F

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,560
is called conditional expected value, and

94
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,680
it's denoted expected value of R given F.

95
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,680
First, I should point out that

96
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,919
F is a

97
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,259
sigma algebra. So, it's a list of events.

98
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,840
And then I should point out the

99
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,699
difference between conditional expected

100
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,460
value, expected value of R given F, and

101
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,919
ordinary expected value, expected value

102
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,360
of R.

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,240
If I know X and Y, my best prediction

104
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
of R may depend on X and Y. So, in general,

105
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,500
expected value of R given F is a sigma

106
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,259
algebra, while ordinary usual

107
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,500
unconditional expected value of R is a

108
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,180
constant.

109
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,639
Let's discuss the notation a little bit.

110
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,620
When the sigma algebra is some general

111
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,440
sigma algebra, we just use expected value

112
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,800
of R vertical bar given F.

113
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,820
And in a particular case of of a sigma

114
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,699
algebra generated by random variables X

115
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,120
and Y, we can write in full form expected

116
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,460
value of R given sigma algebra generated

117
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,280
by X and Y, or we simply write expected

118
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,979
value of R, given X and Y.

119
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,460
Sometimes we can simplify conditional

120
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,979
expected value, and sometimes we can emit

121
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,840
conditioning. The first case is when R is

122
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,259
independent of X and Y. So, knowledge of X

123
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,340
and Y is useless in predicting the value

124
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,740
of R. So, that means the best prediction

125
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,320
of R given, that you know

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,560
X and Y, is independent of X and Y,

127
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,020
because your knowledge is useless. And

128
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,280
it's equal to expected value of R. That

129
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,160
represents the situation, when you know

130
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,680
nothing useful about R.

131
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,060
And the second case, it's a little bit

132
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,800
strange, but if you think a little bit

133
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,440
it's natural. Expected value of

134
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,900
conditional expected value of R, given F,

135
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,479
is an ordinary expected value of R. What

136
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,400
does this mean?

137
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,400
The average of the best guess is the

138
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,440
average of the predicted variable. Yeah.

139
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,960
If it's your best guess, then you should

140
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,740
be right on average.

141
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,960
And the other extreme case is the case,

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,780
when the random variable R is completely

143
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,539
known. So, that means in formal terms

144
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,520
measurable with respect to sigma algebra

145
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,539
F. Then you may treat it like a known

146
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,039
constant.

147
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,220
That means expected value of R given F,

148
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,060
If your information in F is enough to

149
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,479
calculate the exact value of R, and the

150
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,599
conditional expected value is just R.

151
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,900
Or going back to our Wiener process,

152
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,979
expected value of 2 exponent of 5 WT,

153
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,979
given that you know WT is 2 times

154
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,220
exponent of 5 WT.

155
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,720
Or some more, more complicated

156
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,800
formulas. Expected value of 2 RS plus R

157
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
squared given sigma algebra F, and you

158
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,720
have enough information to calculate R.

159
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,660
So, you treat R like a constant. You move

160
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,360
it out of the expected value, that gives

161
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,599
you 2R times expected value of S given F.

162
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,520
Maybe you have enough information about

163
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,080
this, maybe not, plus R squared.

164
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,259
And now the last concept the concept of

165
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,539
conditional variance. The conditional

166
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,259
variance of R given sigma algebra F is

167
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,560
the conditional expected value of the

168
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,860
squared error of the best prediction.

169
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,919
Let's write in formulas. Variance of R

170
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,740
given F is equal to expected value of

171
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,139
delta square root given, that we know F.

172
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,379
Well, delta is a prediction error. So, that

173
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,860
means R the value of R minus best

174
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,000
prediction expected value of R given f.

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,580
And by analogy we can see the formula,

176
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,380
that conditional variance of R given

177
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,839
sigma algebra F is expected value of R

178
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,080
squared, given sigma algebra F minus the

179
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,180
squared value of conditional expected

180
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,120
value of R given F. This formula mimics

181
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,760
the formula for ordinary unconditional

182
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,600
expected value, maybe you recognize it.

183
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,700
Now let's move on to the properties of

184
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,740
conditional variance. Irrelevant

185
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,440
information may be emitted like in the

186
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,620
case of expected value. If R is

187
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,600
independent of your knowledge, your

188
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,640
knowledge is described by

189
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,180
sigma algebra F. Then expected value of R

190
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,820
given sigma algebra F is just expect

191
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,700
value of R. And the same is true for the

192
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,620
variance, conditional variance, so far

193
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,500
given, that you know F gives you

194
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,140
nothing useful about R, so it's just a

195
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,880
variance of R.

196
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,120
And E the other extreme case. If R is

197
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,160
completely known or in mathematical

198
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,140
terms is measurable with respect to

199
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,260
sigma algebra F, then we may treat R like

200
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,820
a constant.

201
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,260
So, for example, with  Brownian motion.

202
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,560
Variance of two exponent of 5Wt given,

203
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,560
that you know WT. So, for you WT is

204
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,680
completely predictable. It's like like a

205
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,140
non-constant. So, the variance is zero, the

206
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,300
conditional variance.

207
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,899
And more complicated example: variance of

208
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,380
2 RS plus R squared, given sigma algebra

209
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,019
F, has enough information to exactly

210
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,640
calculate R.

211
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,820
So, 2R is moved out of the variance with

212
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,300
square root, with square. You multiply it

213
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,100
by conditional variance of S, given

214
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,760
signals per F plus 0, because R squared

215
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,480
works like a constant.

216
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,360
And let's

217
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,680
provide a small summary.

218
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,740
Sigma algebra, sigma of X and Y is a

219
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,380
collection of all events that can be

220
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,720
stated using random variables X and Y.

221
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,700
For example, it contains the event X is

222
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,279
equal to Y, and many, many more other

223
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,420
events.

224
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,000
Conditional expected value, expected

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,399
value of R, given X and Y, is the best

226
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,220
prediction of R using the random

227
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,620
variables X and Y.

228
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,500
And finally, conditional variance of R,

229
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,519
given random variables X and Y is a

230
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,380
conditional expected value of the square

231
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,440
root error of the best prediction. And a

232
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,940
little bit later, we will see, that

233
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,240
basically, the price of an asset and a

234
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
black Insurance model is just a

235
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,480
conditional expected value.
