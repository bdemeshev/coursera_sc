3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:07,560
In this video we will introduce the main tool to work

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,620
with stochastic integrals - the Ito's lemma.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,559
We will start with a light version for

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,599
functions of time and Wiener process. 

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,680
Then we will discuss, how to use Ito's lemma

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,140
to check, whether their processes in

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,279
martingale.

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,500
And then we will introduce a more

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,920
general version of Ito's lemma.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,960
So, let's start.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,480
If YT is a function of WT and T, then it

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,020
may be written in the form of a Ito

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,340
process. So, YT equals to Y0 plus

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,879
ordinary integral from 0 to T of F prime

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,120
with respect to T plus 1 over 2,

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,140
second derivative of F with respect to W

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,120
W times DU plus Ito integral from 0 to

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,600
TF Prime with respect to W times dWu.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,439
Or we may write the same theorem in the

22
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,040
short form. In the short form the theorem

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,460
says, that if YT is a function of WT and

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,100
T, then it may be written in the short

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,299
form as dYt equals to F prime

26
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,860
with respect to W times dWt plus F prime

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,479
with respect to T times DT plus 1 over 2

28
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,600
times second derivative F prime prime

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,439
with respect to WW times DT.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
Let's get used to this lemma, because

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,659
it's not that intuitive.

32
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,439
Let's express the process YT equal to WT

33
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,820
cubed times T power 4, as an Ito process.

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,060
Okay, let's calculate dYt.

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,579
First, derivatives are 3Wt squared

36
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,699
times T power 4 and we multiply it by

37
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,879
dWt. And the first derivative with

38
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,940
respect to T is 4Wt cubed times T

39
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,420
cubed, we multiply it by DT. And we add 

40
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,500
a second derivative with respect to WW, so

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,040
it will be 6 WT times T power 4, but we

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,099
divide it by 2 according to the it is

43
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,640
Lemma. We simplify this expression,

44
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,920
and, finally, we get the full form, that YT

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,900
equals to 0, Y0, we plug in 0 instead of

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,980
T,

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,440
plus

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,180
Ito integral from 0 to T 3WU squared U

49
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,200
power 4 times dWu plus ordinary integral

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,120
from 0 to T for WU cubed times U cubed

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,900
plus 3 WU times U power 4 times DU.

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,480
Okay, how we may use it? Let's check,

53
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,400
whether the process YT equals to

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,099
WT power 4 minus T squared is a

55
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,060
martingale.

56
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,360
We will calculate dYt by the same

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,400
lemma.

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,220
We take first derivatives with respect

59
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,099
to WT and T, we add 1 over 2 times the

60
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,239
second derivative with respect to WW. So,

61
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,260
it will be plus 1 over 2 times 12 WT

62
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,340
squared.

63
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,620
We simplify, we get 4 WT cubed times dWt

64
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,099
plus 6 WT squared minus 2T times DT.

65
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:02,519
And, hence, in the full form YT is a sum

66
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,440
of 0 plus Ito integral plus three mill

67
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,140
integral. Oh, it has Riemann integral
68
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,739
inside, so, it's not a martingale.

69
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,079
That's very easy. We don't need to

70
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,899
calculate conditional expected value at

71
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,699
all to check, whether the process is a

72
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,300
martingale. We calculate the short form

73
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,979
dYt using Ito's lemma. If it contains  the

74
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,340
the term with DT, it's not a martingale,

75
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,160
if the term with DT disappears, then

76
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,800
our process YT is a martingale.

77
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,400
One more exercise: let's express Yt

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,919
equal to WT squared as an Ito process.

79
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,560
And let's prove the formula for an

80
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,060
integral from 0 to T of WU times dWu.

81
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,840
We calculate dYt, using Ito's lemma, so, it

82
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,900
will be 2 WT times DWT plus 0 times DT,

83
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,960
plus the second derivative 1 over 2

84
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,160
times 2 times DT. We simplify it, and we

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,479
get 2 WT times DWT plus DT.

86
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,500
We recover the full form, YT is equal to

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,120
0 Y 0, I plug 0 instead of TW 0 squared

88
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,840
is zero, so, it's 0 plus Ito integral from

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,020
0 to T to WU times dWu plus original

90
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,100
integral from 0 to T of 1 times DU. But

91
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,380
this last integral is very easy, it's

92
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,800
just T.

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,280
And, hence, I get the expression for

94
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,960
integral from 0 to T of WU times dWu, it

95
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,080
will be equal one over two times WT

96
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,960
squared minus T, as in our tables.

97
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,080
And we have a more  general version of

98
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,699
it is lemma. If YT is a function of XT

99
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,820
and t, where XT, as an E to process,

100
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,880
then YT may be written in the short form,

101
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,660
as dYt is f prime with respect to X

102
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,139
times DX plus F prime with respect to T

103
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,680
times DT plus 102 times second

104
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,880
derivative with respect to X

105
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,699
times dXt squared.

106
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,479
And to calculate dXt, we use symbolic

107
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,199
rules. DT times DWT is 0. DT times DT is 0,

108
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,479
DWT times DWT is DT. Once again, 

109
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,860
these objects like DWT or dYt, or dXt,

110
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,600
they have no meaning, no rigorous

111
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,060
mathematical meaning. This is just a

112
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,479
short form to write less to save time.

113
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,759
And when you write the short form, you

114
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,539
can recover the correct full form.

115
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's consider an example.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,680
We know, that DST, the

117
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,300
share price in the framework of Black 

118
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,819
and Shcoles model

119
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,000
is given by M times M times ST times

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,860
DT plus sigma times ST times DWT. And

121
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,759
let's imagine, that YT is a square of ST.

122
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,639
So, the share price squared. Let's

123
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,759
calculate dYt, and let's recover the full

124
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,280
form for YT.

125
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,139
We use  the second version of Ito's lemma.

126
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,199
dYt is the first derivative with

127
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,400
respect to S. So, it will be

128
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,860
2 ST times DST plus

129
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,139
the first derivative with respect to T.

130
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,840
There are no T. So, it will be 0 times

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,860
DT plus we add 1 over 2 times the second

132
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,099
derivative with respect to ST, so, it will

133
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:18,900
be 2 times we multiply by DST squared.

134
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,620
We open the brackets instead of DST, we

135
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,979
plug in the original expression MST

136
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,960
DT plus sigma STDWT.

137
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,360
Now we open the square,

138
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,440
but DT times DT will replace by zero. DT

139
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,440
times DWT will replace by zero, when we

140
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,479
calculate a square.

141
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,600
And the only remaining term will be

142
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,220
sigma ST times  DWT

143
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,140
times DWT. But DWT times dWT is DT. And,

144
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,920
hence, we rearrange our terms and get the

145
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,620
final expression 2 MST squared plus

146
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,160
sigma squared ST squared times DT plus

147
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,080
2 sigma ST squared times dWt.

148
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,620
And we recover the full form: YT or ST

149
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,980
squared is equal to S0 squared plus

150
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,820
stochastic integral from 0 to T to sigma

151
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,019
SU squared times dWu plus ordinary

152
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,820
integral from 0 to T to MSU squared

153
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,860
plus sigma squared SU squared times DU.

154
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,620
There is an easy way to memorize Ito's lemma.

155
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,540
If you have a function YT of XT

156
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,440
ZTT, where XT and ZT are Ito 

157
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,380
processes, then the short form of YT may

158
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,040
be obtained in two steps. First calculate

159
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,140
the second order taylor expansion of

160
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,380
this function F and then simplify the

161
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,600
result using symbolic rules DT times dYt.

162
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,500
DWT is 0, DT times DT is zero, DWT times

163
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,019
DWT is DT.

164
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,100
And this process will give the correct a

165
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,600
full form, if you will replace the short

166
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,959
form by the corresponding full form.

167
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,080
And, once again, we should remember, that 

168
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,860
dWt, dYt, dXt, dZt

169
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,560
this is just a convention to simplify

170
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,019
notation. They do not exist. They are not

171
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,600
random variables. It's impossible to

172
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,420
calculate the expected value of DWT. It's

173
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,300
impossible to calculate its variance. It is

174
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,100
just a quick way, an easy way to write the steps necessary to obtain the full form.


178
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,640
And let's proceed to the summary.

179
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,880
It is lemma is a basic tool to study

180
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,820
stochastic integrals. One may use, for

181
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,700
example, it is lamb to check, whether a

182
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,920
given process in continuous time is a

183
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,399
martingale.

184
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,180
The Ito's lemma is easily memorized in a

185
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,680
short form, using symbolic rules DT times

186
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,560
DWT is 0, DT times DT is 0, DWT times DWT

187
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,959
is DT.
