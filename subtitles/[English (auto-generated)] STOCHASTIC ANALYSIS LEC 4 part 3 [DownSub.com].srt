00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,599
The Black and Scholes model assumes no arbitrage pricing. So,

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,259
let's solve some non-arbitrage pricing problem. 

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,800
Imagine a market, when we have the risk-free rate

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,180
is equal to 0 0 or 5 1 3,

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,840
the price of a share at time zero is 7.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,619
And we are interested in a call option

11
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,739
price. We strike price K equal to zero.

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,920
And we have two more assets, that are traded  in our market. 

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,160
So, for 0.8 we can buy a very interesting

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,579
contract, that will pay us

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,780
one dollar, if S2, the share price at

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,940
moment 2, will be less than zero. And we

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,760
have another strange contract. We can buy for

20
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,400
current price three dollars. We can buy a

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,860
contract, that will give us one share, but

22
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,180
only if the share price at moment 2

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,119
will be less than 10.

24
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,119
Okay, we have a market, and we need to

25
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,060
price a call option.

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,840
First, let's fill this table with more

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,500
information. Okay, if I'd like just to

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,600
have one share at time T equal to 2 unconditionally.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,100
Then, obviously, I can just buy it now,

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,520
put it in a box and wait two years

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,540
and, oh, I have one share. So, this 

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,640
simple contract can be simulated with

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,420
one share. So, its price is just seven.

35
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,060
If I'd like to have  just one dollar

36
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,579
unconditionally at time moment two, how

37
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,598
can I simulate this contract? Oh, I

38
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,560
need to put some amount of money on a bank account,

40
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,180
but they're risk-free, interest rate is

41
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,500
0 0 5 1 3. Okay, so,

42
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,160
the current price of one dollar now

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,980
is exponent of minus 2 times R

44
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,580
times one dollar. And if I will calculate

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,660
this exponent of minus 2 times 0 0 5 1 3

46
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,459
times 1 dollar or two years later, I will

47
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,260
get roughly 0 9. Okay, so, to get one dollar,

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,800
I need to pay now zero nine dollars.

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,400
Now what is a call option?  What is a call option?

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,660
I don't know its price, yeah, it's some

54
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,260
C0 I'm searching for. Yeah, that is

55
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,780
C0 they call option price,

56
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:18,019
but the call option price has this structure of payments.

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,700
If S2 is less, than 10 then call option

59
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,280
price or call option is the right to buy

60
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,019
a share, so, basically, if S2 is less

61
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,440
than zero, this call option is useless

62
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,159
and its price is zero. But if S2 is

63
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,099
greater or equal than 10, then call

64
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,519
option price is in the money.

65
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,420
And its price is given by

66
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,420
S2 minus strike price, strike price is 10,

67
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,580
so, S2 minus 10.

68
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,060
Okay, and let's exploit the non-arbitrage

70
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,080
condition for these five,

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,940
basically, we have five assets.

72
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,700
I will replicate my option,

73
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,180
my call option using four other

74
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,699
assets. So, I will use replication

75
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,940
strategy. Oka,y let's add weights a b

76
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,880
small C, that is not a call option price,

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,440
that is just small C and small D. I will

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,800
invest A, B, C, D, I will buy a assets

79
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,020
of the first type B, assets of the second

80
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,660
type C, assets of this third type and so

81
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:53,600
on. And I would like to recover this payoff structure.

83
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,919
Okay, let's do it.

84
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,020
Let's work with our simulated asset.

85
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,080
What is the current price of this replication.

87
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:16,620
We have a times 0 8 plus b times 3, plus

89
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,500
c times 7, plus d times 0 9. Okay, and

90
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,259
what is the future payoff structure of

91
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,860
this combination?

92
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,460
The future payoff structure of this

93
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,860
combination is the following:

94
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,580
if S2 is less than 10, which one will work?

96
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,360
If S2 is less than 10, I will receive this

98
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,460
dollar, I will receive this share, I

99
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,860
will receive this and I will receive

100
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,759
that, because the third and the force are

101
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:14,300
unconditional. Okay, so, I will get a plus d plus S2 times b plus c.

109
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,720
What happens, if S2 is greater or equal

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,160
than 10? One I will get.

112
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:31,660
I will get unconditional assets, and that's all. So, basically, if S2

114
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,380
is greater than 10, I will get only D

115
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,460
plus S2 times C.

116
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,639
And I need to replicate my call option.

117
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,660
Okay, so, it's easy to replicate: I just

118
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:56,680
need to set a plus, D should be zero,

120
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:05,539
B plus C should be zero, D should be equal to -10,

123
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,600
and C should be equal to 1. I have a

124
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,440
very big system of four linear equations.

125
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,860
That's easy to solve them.

126
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:24,539
A is 10 and B is minus one.

128
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,660
So, a is 10.

130
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,000
B is -1.

131
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,340
C is one.

132
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,319
and D is -10.

134
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,979
And if I buy 10 first type assets, I

135
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,960
sell one second type asset, I buy one

136
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,000
type asset, and I sell minus, I sell

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
10 force type asset.Okay, so, the C0 should be

141
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:26,240
10 times 0 8, minus 1 times 3, plus 1 times 7, minus 10 times 0 9.
