3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,200
Let's consider one more no-arbitrage

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,960
pricing problem. We work in a setup of

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,139
Black and Scholes model. We assume, that S0,

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,779
the starting price of a share, is ten

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,080
dollars. Risk-free interest rate is 0.05

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,220
And sigma is 0 1 the volatility.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,980
Okay, and let's consider a very, very

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,000
strange asset, very strange asset X. At

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,680
time moment 2 this strange asset pays

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,579
you X2 cube, S2 cube.

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,460
If S2 will be 10, you will receive one

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,100
thousand. If S2 will be one, you will

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,219
receive one. If S2 will be 5, you will

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,460
receive 125 dollars. That's a very

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,059
strange asset. And let's price it. 

19
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,239
There is a unique no-arbitrage price 

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,220
in the framework of Black and Scholes model.

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,280
This is current price X0, and let's

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,740
find it out.

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,640
First, let's do some simple remarks: that

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
if I have one dollar in future, this

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,759
future dollar now is priced less

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,259
than one. And it's actual price is 

27
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:32,220
exponent of minus 2 times R, because I

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,920
need to discount this future dollar to

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,560
current prices. And one share in the

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,700
future is just one share at the start is 10.

32
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,960
Okay, so let's price our strange asset X.

33
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,960
We have a theorem: that's under some nice

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,780
probability measure, discounted price

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,619
is a martingale. So, martingales, they

36
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,979
make our life easier. So, this theorem

37
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,259
says, that's very easy to calculate X0,

38
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,540
it's expected value.

39
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,060
Okay, we have, that X0

40
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,819
is an expected value, a strange expected

41
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,280
value, risk-free expected value

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,099
of discounted future payoff of our

43
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,220
contract. So, it is expected value star

44
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,340
risk-free expected value of discounted.

45
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,160
So, I need to write exponent of minus 2R

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,120
here times future or price of my asset X2.

48
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,519
And to make calculations easier, we

49
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,900
will express X2 in terms of risk-free

50
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,080
interest rate. Okay, what is X2?

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,080
X2 is just S 2 Cube. And what is S2? In the black

53
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,840
And Scholes model it is S0 times exponent.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,660
And here I may write two possible

55
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,340
expressions for St, but I will use the

56
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,459
expression with risk-free interest rate

57
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,300
R and start Brownian motion.

58
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,099
Okay, it will be R minus sigma square

59
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:33,080
root over 2 times future time moment 2 plus sigma times W2 star.

63
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,519
And I need to calculate cube.

64
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,700
Okay, how do we calculate cube? We will

65
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,900
сube, as 0, and we just multiply by three

66
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,780
the expression inside exponent. So, we

67
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:58,840
will get X2 equals to S 0 cubed multiplied by exponent

72
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:17,260
of 6 times R minus sigma squared over 2 plus 3 sigma W2 star.

75
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:26,460
Okay, and now let's calculate its start expected value.

77
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,660
X0 is a start expected value of

78
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,199
exponent minus 2R times S0 cubed

79
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,080
times exponent of 6R minus 3 sigma

80
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,540
squared plus three sigma W2 star.

81
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,240
And I need to close the bracket for expected value.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,139
Okay, I move a constants out of the

84
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,380
expected value. This is constant, this is

85
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,360
constant, this is like a constant,

86
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,160
and I get expect exponent of minus 2R times S0

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:23,699
cubed times exponent of 6 R minus 3 sigma squared,

90
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,120
multiplied by, what is left

91
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,580
expected value of star of exponent of 3

92
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,280
sigma W2 Star.

94
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,600
Okay, and what is this expected value?

96
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,860
We know, that we have even proven it with

97
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,100
martingales, that ordinary expected

98
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,880
value of exponent of

99
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,400
alpha times WT, is just exponent of alpha

100
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,240
squared times T over 2. And the same

101
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,840
holes of four started version of this

102
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,220
expression. So, expected value star, so,

103
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,199
expected value with respect to different

104
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,460
probability measure A of exponent of

105
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:26,240
alpha times Wt star, that's the same thing, because the

107
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,800
distribution of WT with respect to

108
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,380
probability measure P is the same, as the

109
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,280
distribution of WT star with respect

110
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,380
to probability measure P star. So, it's

111
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,919
just exactly the same value

112
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,660
Alpha scored T over 2.

114
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:51,840
And, hence, I can continue my calculations of X0.

116
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,900
I simplify a little bit, I see minus 2

117
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,759
here and 6 there. So, I will get

118
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:08,120
exponent of 4R minus 3 sigma squared times S0 cubed.

120
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,300
And this expected value. Now I need

121
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,740
just to find the alpha in this term.

123
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,639
And I get the exponent

124
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,680
of alpha squared 9 sigma squared times T.

125
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,819
T is 2 times 2 divided by 2.

126
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:46,020
And, finally, I get S0 cube times exponent of 4R.

130
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,639
Here I have minus 3 sigma squared,

131
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,120
here I have plus 9 sigma squared. So, I

132
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,560
have a plus 6 sigma squared. And that is a fair price.

133
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,039
The unique no-arbitrage price, let's copy it.

135
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:12,479
So, we have found, that X0 is just, as zero

136
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:21,080
cube times exponent of 4r plus 6 sigma square root.

139
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,740
And if we plug in our our values,

140
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:36,539
then we get, X0 is just 1000 multiplied by exponent

142
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:44,459
4 times, 0 0 5 is 0 2 times 0 0 6, it will

143
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:55,459
be 0 26. And we will get approximately 1296.9.

145
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
And voila!

146
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:08,459
We have found unique no-arbitrage price of this tricky asset.
