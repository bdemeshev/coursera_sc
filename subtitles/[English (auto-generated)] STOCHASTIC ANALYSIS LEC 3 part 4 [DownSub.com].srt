3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,059
In this video we will introduce Black and Scholes model. First, we will discuss the

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,519
assumptions of the model. Next, we will

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,920
move on to the main question.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,859
And, finally, we will solve our first

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,840
stochastic differential equation, that

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,500
describes the price of a share.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,779
Okay,

10
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,060
in the Black and Scholes model unique shape

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,039
type is traded.

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,740
And the share price satisfies the

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,059
following stochastic differential

14
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,780
equation: DST is equal to USD times DT

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,140
plus sigma ST times DWT. What does it

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,300
mean intuitively? If we consider a small

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,820
increment of time, then the change of

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,579
share price DST

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,719
is a sum of two terms. One roughly

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,039
non-stochastic muST times DT plus, the

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,640
second one is statistic: sigma times ST

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,579
times DWT.

23
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,700
And the risk-free interest rate are in

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,500
the Black and Scholes model is constant,

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,900
and unique for all horizons for one

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,299
month, for two months is for one year, for

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,100
five seconds is the same.

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,100
There are no taxes, no dividends, no

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,659
transactions costs in the 

30
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,720
Black and Scholes model. Time is continuous, and

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,640
shares are infinitely divisible: you can

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,479
buy zero, zero, zero, zero one share.

33
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,720
And short selling is about you can sell

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,299
-5 assets.

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,479
And there are no arbitrage opportunities.

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,200
So, that means you cannot make profit

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,520
without risk.

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,240
And these parameters mu sigma R, they

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,000
are known constants.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,939
The main question we would like to

41
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,439
answer is - how to calculate the price of

42
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,680
such or that financial claim?

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,799
So, for example, at time moment T equal to

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,179
2 John would like to get 10

45
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:11,760
rubels, if the price S2 is greater than

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,879
100 and nothing otherwise.

47
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,879
How much he should pay now?

48
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,819
That is the question.

49
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,220
And let's start solving the 

50
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,560
Black and Scholes model, and answering  the

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,840
main question by solving the stochastic

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,879
differential equation for the price. It

53
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,560
is DST equal to Mu St plus times DT plus

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,160
sigma ST times DWT.

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,060
Or in full form with integrals

56
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,140
STS0 plus Riemann integral USUDU

57
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,160
plus stochastic integral sigma SU dWu.

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,220
Let's focus once again on the short form,

59
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,739
because it's a little bit easier to work

60
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,819
with. So, DST is UST times DT plus sigma ST

61
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,160
times DWT.

62
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,040
And let's recall our mnemonic rules, and

63
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
let's calculate DST squared with

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,620
mnemonic rules. So, it is Mu ST times DT

65
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,459
plus sigma S T D W T squared. DT times DT

66
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,860
is 0. DT times DWT is 0. And DWT times DWT

67
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,400
is DT. We open the brackets, and we

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,519
get sigma squared times ST squared

69
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,959
times DT. Okay, now let's consider the log

70
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,500
of ST. The process YT is just a logarithm

71
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,800
a natural logarithm of ST. According to

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,060
Ito's lemma, dYt is equal to the first

73
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,180
derivative with respect to S times DS

74
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,940
plus the first derivative with respect

75
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,000
to T times DT, but there are no T in

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,819
logarithm of S, and the derivative of

77
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,099
logarithm of S is one over S.

78
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,819
And in the Ito's lemma we have a second

79
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,420
derivative with respect to S multiplied

80
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,640
by 1 over 2, the second derivative is

81
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,640
minus 1 of S squared.And we multiply it

82
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,120
by DS squared, and we already have the

83
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,220
expression for DS squared, that was

84
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,120
calculated one Step before. And, hence, we

85
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,139
get the expression for dYt. dYt is Mu

86
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,500
DT plus sigma tWt minus sigma squared

87
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,900
over 2 times DT.

88
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,180
Hmm, that's great! we have the equation

89
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,360
for logarithm of share price in a short

90
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,919
form. dyt equals some constant times DT

91
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,220
plus sigma times DWT. We go to the full

92
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,080
form.

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,259
And in the full form we have two easy

94
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,220
integrals. We have YT is equal to Y0

95
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,560
plus Riemann integral of a constant

96
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,360
times DU plus Ito's integral sigma

97
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,120
times DW. We can calculate these

98
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,780
integrals. And we get logarithm of ST is

99
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,940
equal to logarithm of S0, because it's

100
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,240
the value of Y0 plus mu minus sigma

101
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,000
squared over 2 times T plus sigma times

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,479
DWT. And, as we have an expression for

103
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,400
logs, then we go to the expression for S.

104
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,479
Finally, ST is equal to S0 times exponent

105
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,280
of Mu minus sigma squared over 2

106
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,139
times T plus sigma times WT. And we see,

107
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,419
that in the Black and Scholes model the

108
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,020
price of a share follows the geometric

109
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,479
Browonial motion.

110
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,539
Let's make a small summary.

111
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,340
The main goal of the Black and Scholes model

112
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,000
is to calculate the price of such

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,759
of that financial claim.

114
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,479
The share price follows the geometric

115
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,940
Brownian motion. So, ST

116
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,900
is equal to S0 times exponent of Mu

117
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,120
minus sigma squared, so, into Times T plus

118
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,360
sigma times WT.

119
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,320
Risk-free rate is assumed constant. And I

120
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,419
should point out, that there are no

121
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,000
arbitrage opportunities in the Black and Scholes model,

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,759
you cannot make risk-free

123
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,919
profit, you should risk to make profit.
