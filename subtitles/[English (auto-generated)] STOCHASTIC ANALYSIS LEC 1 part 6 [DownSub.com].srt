3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,200
Let's work with martingales, because

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,380
martingales are very powerful  in

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,900
option pricing. So, let's start working

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,099
with them.

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,039
Okay, let's consider the process XT, which

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,440
is equal to 6 times WT squared plus

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,980
alpha T. And we know, that XT is a

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,680
martingale, so, on average it is not going

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,720
up, it's not going down.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,140
And our goal is to find alpha, when

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,239
it's not specified we are working with

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,579
natural filtration, so, our information

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,600
available at time moment T is generated

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,140
by observing the Wiener process. So, we

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,579
know values WU for U from zero up to

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,200
time moment T.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,480
So, basically, that means that the time

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,940
moment T we know WT and all previous W's.

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,520
Okay, what is the main property of

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,320
martingales. The main property of martingales, 

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,640
that expected value of future XT,

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,340
given current information is current

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,159
value XS.

26
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,159
Okay, and let's find Alpha, that will

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,979
solve this equation. So, we will calculate

28
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,920
left hand side and make it equal to the

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,119
right hand side.

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,380
Okay, what is the expected value of 6 WT

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,180
squared plus Alpha T given FS.

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,360
Once again, we will use our trick we will

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,240
decompose future value into past value

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,140
plus independent increment. Let's do it.

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,140
We have alpha T is a non-random quality,

36
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,500
quantity we move it out of the expected

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,360
value.

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,040
And we get inside expected value

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,740
T squared given FS. Now

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,640
our tricks is in play. We replace

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,299
WT, as WS known value plus future

42
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,319
increment WT minus WS squared given FS.

43
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,099
Let's continue.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,379
We get alpha T plus 6 times,

45
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,640
we open the brackets and we will get WS

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,940
squared plus 2 times WS plus increment

47
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,020
WT, minus WS, plus increment squared

48
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,019
WT, minus WS squared given FS.

49
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,220
Now

50
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,660
We see, that we have terms of two types:

51
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,599
WS is known,

52
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,800
is fixed at time

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,540
moment S,

54
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,640
and increment

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,459
is independent

56
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,920
of what we know.

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,580
So, basically, these are two main cases we

58
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,319
work with every time.

59
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,200
So, we get alpha T plus six.

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,099
WS squared is known, so, the best

61
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,500
prediction the X conditional expected

62
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,280
value is Ws squared. Plus it is fixed, so,

63
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,819
we can move it out, it looks like a

64
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:33,140
constant for us. So, we have WS

65
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,540
conditional expected value of WT minus

66
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,040
WS even that we know FS plus conditional

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,140
expected value of WT, minus WS

68
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,299
squared, if we know FS.

69
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,720
We continue.

70
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,140
We see, that this increment is

71
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,200
independent of what we know,

72
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,900
and, hence, we replace conditional

73
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,420
expected value by unconditional one. We

74
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,439
get alpha T plus six WS squared, plus 12

75
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,099
WS times unconditional expected value

76
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,760
of WG, minus WS, plus unconditional

77
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,440
expected value of WT, minus WS squared.

78
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,620
Okay, we know from the definition of

79
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,100
Wiener process, that WT minus WS has

80
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,080
normal distribution with means zero and

81
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,880
variance T minus S.

82
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,400
Hence, this is zero,

83
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,160
and this is exactly

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,040
the variance of WT minus WS, and this is

85
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,660
T minus S.

86
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,780
So, we are almost done.

87
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,259
This is alpha T plus 6 times WS squared,

88
00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:00,500
plus 12 times WS times 0 plus.

89
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,340


90
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,240
I forgot here six.

91
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,720
Plus six times T minus S.

92
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,440
Okay,

93
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,220
what do I have here. I have

94
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,240
6 WS squared

95
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,340
Plus

96
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,460


97
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,680
six plus Alpha times T

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
minus 6 S.

99
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,100
And what should I have to make XT a

100
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,280
martingale. To make XT a martingale, I

101
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,960
should have here 6 WS square root minus,

102
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,060


103
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,259
sorry, plus Alpha times s.

104
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,580


105
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,919
I should have no T there,

106
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,539
so, alpha should be equal to -6.

107
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:04,620
If Alpha is -6, I have no T,

108
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,340
and I have the perfect correspondence

109
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,840
with

110
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,180
XS.

111
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,440
So, we got the value of alpha. Now let's

112
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,479
move one egg and consider exponential

113
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,419
martingale or Wiener process, and let's

114
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:26,600
find out the value of beta.

115
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,600
Once again, we do our famous trick: we

116
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,220
decompose

117
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,400
future value into past value plus

118
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,460
increment. Let's do this first, and then

119
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,620
we will move on to the calculation of

120
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,500
expected value, we said, that it is 6 times

121
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,600
WS plus 6 times WT minus WS

122
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,400
plus beta T.

123
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,419
And we can factor this expression,

124
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:01,620
because plus inside exponent, that is,

125
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,319
basically, multiplication of different

126
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,880
exponents. So, we got exponent of 6 W S

127
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,660
times exponent of 6

128
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,000
increments,

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,319
times exponent of beta T.

130
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,400
Okay, and now let's recall the basic

131
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,940
equation for martingale, the basic

132
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
equation for martingale. The definition

133
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,419
the expected value of YT, given FS should

134
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,020
be YS. So, let's calculate left hand side,

135
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,979
and let's choose  beta to make left

136
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,259
hand side equal to the right hand side.

137
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,819
Okay.

138
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:50,180
So, expected value of exponent of 6 W S

139
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,039
times exponent of six increments

140
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,919
WT minus WS times

141
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:05,400
exponent of beta times T,

142
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,199
given

143
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,860
FS.

144
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,419
This is a

145
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:18,240
fixed value, this is fixed value, so, I

146
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,419
move them out of the expectation,

147
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,160
and I will get

148
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,860

149
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,720
exponent of 6 W S times exponent of beta

150
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,940
T times.

151
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,520
And now I have the expected value of

152
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,159
some function of increment, so my

153
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,500
information is useless, because future

154
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,440
increment is independent of the past

155
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,060
value

156
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,540
of Wiener process, so, I replace this by

157
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,279
unconditional expectation of 6 WT

158
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,540
minus WS.

159
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,500
Now let's look at the moment generating

160
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,380
function of a standard normal random

161
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,260
variable. If Z is a standard normal

162
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,360
random variable, then its moment

163
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,660
generating function or expectation of

164
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,959
exponent of U times Z is equal by

165
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,320
exponent of U squared over 2. So, in my

166
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,720
case where is that, but I know that here,

167
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,260
but I may easily introduce it. I know,

168
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,720
that

169
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,160
the WT minus WS has exactly the same

170
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,720
distribution, as square root of T minus S

171
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,660
times Z, because left and right hand

172
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,899
sides they both have a normal

173
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,339
distribution

174
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,180
with mean 0 and variance T minus S.

175
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,440
So, I may just think of this increment or,

176
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,519
as

177
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,240
a square root of T minus S times Z. Okay,

178
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,560
so,  I need to calculate expected value

179
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,019
of exponent of 6 times square root of T

180
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,160
minus S times Z.

181
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,160
And according to the moment generating

182
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,640
function,

183
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:26,760
that will be exponent of 36 times T

184
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,860
minus S over 2.

185
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,339
Bingo! We are almost done. So, we have

186
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:42,140
exponent of 6 W S plus beta T

187
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,040
plus  18

188
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,740
times T minus S.

189
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,339
Okay, let's simplify this a little bit.

190
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,160
And we get

191
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,040
exponent of 6 W S

192
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,420
plus T times

193
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,700
beta plus 18

194
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,660
minus 18 S.

195
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,860
And to make YT is a martingale, we

196
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,079
should get YS

197
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,600
in the right hand side.

198
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,440
So, we should get what is YS. This is the

199
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,300
definition of YT, and to get YS, we

200
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,279
need to have exponent of 6 W S

201
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,100
plus

202
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,200
beta times S.

203
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,560
We should have no T in this expression,

204
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,700
and, so, to cancel out T, and to get beta S

205
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,820
or minus 18, as the only beta, that is

206
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,760
okay, it is beta

207
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,740
equal to minus 18, because with this

208
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,680
value of beta T will cancel out,

209
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,600
and beta S will be exactly minus 18S. So,

210
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,660
we have solve our two problems. We

211
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,839
know, that the first process XT is a

212
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,760
martingale for alpha equal minus 6. And

213
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,700
the second process YT is a martingale

214
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,980
for beta equal to minus 18.

215
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,200
So, we're happy, we have found two

216
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,019
martingales. And martingales will be very

217
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,640
useful in calculating prices of

218
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,779
options in Black and Scholes model.
