3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,740
In this video we will find the formula for the price

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,900
of a call option.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,940
We will start with the definition of a

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,360
call and put options. Then we will find

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,180
the put call option parity.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,760
And then, finally, we will find the price

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,500
of a call option.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,699
Okay, the call option gives you a right to buy

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,420
one share at a specified strike price K on a specified date t.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,540
And the put option gives you on the

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,600
contrary a right to sell one share at a

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,540
specified strike price K on a specified

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,379
date T. In mathematical terms, that means,

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,239
that CT, the payoff, that the call option gives

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,640
you, is equal to St minus K, if St is

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,699
bigger than K, because, if St the share

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,559
price is bigger than K,

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,339
you will use your right to buy cheap to

24
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,920
buy at the price K. And you will

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,860
immediately sell the share and the

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,080
prices T, and your profit will be, as T

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,020
minus K. If the share price is too low,

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,400
you will not use your right to buy a

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,820
share at a specified strike price key.

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,659
And by the same logic, the price of

31
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,020
a put option at time moment big T PT is

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,220
equal to K minus St, if St is lower than

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,520
K. In this case you have incentives to

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,520
use your right. But if St is bigger than

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,520
K, you will not use your right to sell

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,479
one share, and your profit P big T will be zero.

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,680
Okay, let's look at this formulas for

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,960
CT and for PT, and let's subtract PT

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,840
from CT. We get CT minus PT is St minus K.

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,719
In any possible state of the world if St

42
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,940
is bigger than K, if St is lower than

43
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,140
K, this difference is St minus K.

44
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,580
So, the difference CT minus PT can be

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,200
simulated, replicated by holding one

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,360
share St. To have St at the end of time,

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,940
you can just buy one share in the beginning of time.

49
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,239
And the K at the end of time are

50
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,780
equivalent to K rubbles multiplied by exponent

51
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,500
of minus RT rubbles now. So, we have

52
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,340
proven, that C0 minus P0 is equal to S0

53
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,180
minus discounted K exponent minus RT

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,760
times K.

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,060
Now let's move on to the call option price.

57
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,040
We have two knight ducks with us, we call

58
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,220
the derivation is very difficult.

59
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,080
Okay, so, from the general pricing rule we have

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,180
that C0 is discounted exponent minus RT

62
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,860
discounted expected value star of, or

63
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,500
CT given F0.

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,080
But we know the formula for CT, we will

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,140
just rewrite it, using indicator I, that

66
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,620
is equal to 1, when St is bigger than K,

67
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,060
and it's equal to 0 otherwise. So, CT is

68
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,599
just I times CT minus K. We open the

69
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,900
brackets, it's I  times CT minus I times K.

71
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,720
And  the conditional expected value, even if

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
conditional expected value star is

74
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
linear. So, we will calculate the expected

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
value star of I times St minus

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,540
conditional expected value star of I times k.

78
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,599
Okay, let's  first start with the second

80
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,640
term. Why not?


81
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,019
Expected value star of I times K is 

82
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,600
constant, we move it out of the

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,820
expected value, it's K times expected

84
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,400
value star of I given our information,

85
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,880
described by sigma algebra of zero, but

86
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,960
the indicator is either one or zero. So,

87
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,840
the expected value of the indicator is a

88
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,940
probability, that it will be equal to 1.

89
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,060
So, its probability star that St is

90
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,900
bigger than K.

91
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,120
Let's go down to WT star, the event St

92
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,979
bigger than K.

93
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,919
In other terms it's logarithm of St

94
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,320
bigger, than logarithm of K.

95
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,740
Or logarithm of S0 plus R minus

96
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,840
sigma square root of 2 times T plus

97
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,259
sigma Wt star bigger than logarithm of K.

99
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,780
Or in terms of WT star we have Wt star

100
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,320
bigger than this fraction.

101
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,220
We will standardize WD star, so we

102
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,419
subtract 0, the expected value star of WT star we

104
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,600
divide by square root of variance by square root of T.

106
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,220
And we reverse the inequality, and we get

107
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,000
the event St bigger than K, is

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,940
equivalent to the event at minus Wt

109
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,000
star divided by square root of T, is less

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,639
than a constant D. The previous fraction

111
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,620
additionally divided by square root of T.

112
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,520
And here in the left side 0 minus WD

113
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,620
star divided by square root of T has

114
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,440
normal distribution 0 1. So, this

115
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
probability can be calculated it's

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,940
called cumulative distribution function.

118
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,500
We have done one half of the job. So,

119
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,300
expected value star of I times K given

120
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,360
information F0 is K times

121
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,759
probability star, that St is bigger than

122
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,600
K. Or K times normal cumulative distribution function

124
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,479
at the point D, where D is this fraction

125
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,020
Ln is 0 minus Ln K plus R minus sigma

126
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,560
squared over 2 times T divided by sigma

127
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,900
times square root of T.

128
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,280
Okay, let's move on to the final answer.

130
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,979
The first term: it's expected value star

131
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,880
of I times St. We plug in the value of

132
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,880
St, it's a 0 times exponent.

133
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,580
We plug in our indicator. That's an

135
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,220
indicator of WT star is less than D

136
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,440
times square root of T.

137
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,160
And now we have only Wiener process

138
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,340
inside our expected value. This expected

139
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,280
value we have in the tables and, so,

140
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,280
basically, we obtain our final answer for

141
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,020
the first term, as 0 is normal a standard

142
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,419
cumulative distribution function at the

143
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:26,280
point D plus sigma square root of T.

144
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,639
And we have the famous call option price

145
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,860
formula. C0 is equal to exponent minus RT

146
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,800
the discounting factor times brackets.

147
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,880
The first term is S0 multiplied by

148
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,400
normal distribution function at the

149
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,060
point D Plus Sigma square root of T

150
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,660
minus the second term K strike price

151
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,020
multiplied by normal distribution,

152
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,060
cumulative distribution function at the

153
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,819
point D, where D is a fraction logarithm

154
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,340
of a zero minus logarithm of K plus R

155
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,800
minus sigma square root over 2 times T

156
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,259
divided by sigma square root of T. Bingo!

157
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,740
Let's proceed to the summary. Call option

158
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,800
is right to buy one share, put option is

159
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,379
the right to sell one share.

160
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,940
Put call parity between the prices is C0

161
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,139
minus P0 equals to S0 minus discounted

162
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,080
strike price K.

163
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,000
and the call option price formula is

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
here. C0 is discounted sum of two terms: 

165
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,159
the first term is S0 times cumulative

166
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,800
standard normal distribution function

167
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,580
minus K times the standard normal

168
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,279
distribution function at another point.

169
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,700
In the first term we use the point G

170
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,600
plus sigma times square root of T, in the

171
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,000
second term the cumulative distribution

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,899
function is evaluated at the point D.

173
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,720
We have obtained the famous Black and Scholes call option price formula.
