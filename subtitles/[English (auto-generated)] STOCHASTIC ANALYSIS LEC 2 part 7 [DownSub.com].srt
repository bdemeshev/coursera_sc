3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,480
In this video we will simulate the trajectory of it, as

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,460
integral.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,880
We will use the functions to create the

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,160
trajectory of Wiener process, that we

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,359
have studied a last lecture.

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,160
And then, let's start with Ito integral.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,380
Okay, so, we will create the function get

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,780
in the ground trajectory.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,360
Trajectory and this function will use D,

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,120
the final moment of time and the number of small intervals.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,980
1000 by default the seed. The initial

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,800
value for random number generation.

17
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,620
And let's go. Okay, first, we will create

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,199
deltas increments of Wiener process. We

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,260
will calculate the values of integrand,

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,619
we will multiply deltas increments of

21
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,140
Wiener process by the values of integral,

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,140
and We will integral, and then we will sum

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,299
up these products.

24
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,659
Okay, deltas or increments of Wiener

25
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,240
process may have already made function.

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,180
Get Wiener increments

29
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,520
T is equal to T, and is equal to N.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,979
Seed is equal to seed.

31
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,060
Okay, we got deltas of Wiener

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,540
process. Next we create the Wiener

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,140
process, we create a vector of zeros

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,860
first of size N plus 1, because we have

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,079
N intervals and N plus 1 time moments.

36
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,840
Then we say, that values of W from 1 to N

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,880
plus 1 are just cumulative sums

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,420
of increments of Wiener process.
 
40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,760
Then we create time moments.

41
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,480
We get time T equal to TN equal to N.

42
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,860
Then we calculate our integrand.

43
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,420
Integrand will be

44
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,379
in our case, that is just  W power 3.

45
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:43,440
These are the values of the integrand.

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,239
And then we calculate, basically, the

48
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,180
integrand times delta

49
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,940
or this is delta of integral.

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,120
We just multiply

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,739
integrands value in 10 round values from

52
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,700
0 to N. The last one is not used, because

53
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,459
we have no future increments for the

54
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,760
last value of the integrand.

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,340
And we just multiply it one by one, by

56
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,500
delta of Wiener process.

57
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,879
And we sum up these values.

58
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,620
We say, that in integral

59
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,120
is a vector of zeros big Vector of zeros

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
of size N plus 1.

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,900
And like with Wiener process, we

62
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,459
copy the same logic,

63
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,099
but we apply it to our integral

64
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,159
trajectory. It will be accumulative sum

65
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,540
of increments of the integral of delta's

66
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,860
integral.

67
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,420
Okay, and we return

68
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,180
our integral trajectory.



70
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,439
We have created

71
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,120
our function. Let's check it.

72
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,060
Let T be equal to 2, let N be equal to

73
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,060
one thousand. Let's get



75
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,180
time moments for this T, and for this

76
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,220
N. Let's get the integral trajectory

79
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,020
for this T for this N.

80
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,680
And let's plot it SNS line plot.

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,560
X will be just our T.

82
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,460
And Y will be the values of our integral.

83
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,979
And we see that the time evolution of

84
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,540
our stochastic integral is quite

85
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,820
different from the evolution of the

86
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Wiener process itself. It stays near zero

87
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,000
a long time, we may simulate it more.

88
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,539
And that's another trajectory.

89
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,340
And we may also study the properties of

90
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,199
this stochastic integral empirically.

91
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,500
Let's do this. Now let's calculate the

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,680
variance of

93
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,860
this stochastic integral at time moment

94
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,440
three. So, let's calculate the variance of

95
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,900
I3.

96
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,419
To do this, we will simulate many

97
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,699
trajectories. We will say, that we will

98
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:57,780
simulate

99
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,020
10 000 trajectories. Final moment of time

100
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,600
will be three.

101
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,320
We will subdivide our time interval from

102
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,800
0 to 3 into 1 000

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,960
small time intervals.

104
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,979
And we will keep a record of all final

105
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,620
values of our stochastic integral

106
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,520
trajectory. So, we will say final value,

107
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,240
that will be a vector. We will reserve a

108
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,039
little bit of memory.

109
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,580
We will say, that we need the number

110
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,759
of simulations a vector with this number

111
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,539
of zeros will be reserved. And then we

112
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:44,160
launch a cycle.

113
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,340
We say, that for I ranging from 0 to N

114
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,840
minus 1, so, and sigma and C

115
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,740
for I in. Sorry, I miss thing.

116
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,020
And then what should we create? We should

117
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,419
create the whole trajectory, get the last

118
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,060
value of that trajectory and keep it in

119
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,600
memory. And then we will calculate the

120
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,360
sample variance, that will be close and

121
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,699
closer to the true variance. Well, when we

122
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,699
will increase the number of simulations.

123
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:23,400
Okay, so, integral trajectory

124
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,840
will be get in the

125
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,160
moral trajectory

126
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,440
for

127
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,100
T equal to TN equal to N.



129
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,919
And we will keep track of the last value.

130
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,840
So, final value

131
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,539
number, it will be integral

132
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,639
trajectory

133
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,259
number N,

134
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,099
the last value.

135
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:04,199
So, we launch the cycle, we wait a little

136
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,280
bit.

137
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,220
And then we have a big vector of final

138
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,460
values. Let's see

139
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,160
the beginning of it.

140
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,380
For example, first 10 values.

141
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,360
These are first 10 values of our

142
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,759
experiments. And we basically calculate

143
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,940
the standard deviation.

144
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,020
So, we just say numpy variance of this

145
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,800
big vector.

146
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,980
And we got this estimate of the true

147
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,980
variance. Obviously, that's only an

148
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,620
estimate. And to check, whether the

149
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,800
estimation is precise or not, we may

150
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,140
relaunch our set of simulations

151
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,360
and see, whether the answer is stable.

152
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,560
And we see, that it's more or less stable

153
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,899
it's 270 something.

155
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,000
So, obviously, if we will produce, if we

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,100
will use a higher number of simulations

157
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,880
and higher number of sub intervals, we

158
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,800
will get the result, that is more and

159
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,519
more, and more precise, but for 

160
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,260
infinite number of simulations and

161
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,260
infinite number of  small time

162
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,740
segments, we will need infinite amount of time.
