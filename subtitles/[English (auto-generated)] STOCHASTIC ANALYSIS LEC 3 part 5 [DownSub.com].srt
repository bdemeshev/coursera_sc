[Music]

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,780
We continue with Vasicek rate model. And now we will

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,540
find the solution of this stochastic

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,519
differential equation.

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,220
We will use a very powerful strategy.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,180
Let's face simplify.

9
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:26,720
You can find the solution of a simple

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,460
equation and then modify your solution

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,320
to match the original equation. That's

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,420
very powerful and simple strategy - 

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,760
simplify and modify.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,680
Okay, let's do it. I will be very lazy, I

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,260
don't like this hard problem. I like

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,320
easy problems, so, I will replace the 0 0 5

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,079
by 0. I will replace this

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,039
two by zero. Let's get a very simple 

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,399
equation. So, I will get an equation like

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,219
D and, obviously, this equation will not

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,600
be for interest rate R, but for some

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,760
other At. So, dAt has a much simpler

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,540
equation, so, it will be just minus At

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,979
times dt. So, it's a very simple

25
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,420
differential equations. There are

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,360
non-randomness inside, there are no dWt

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,360
terms. So, I can easily solve it using

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,880
ordinary methods. So, okay, I will have 

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,740
dAt over At is just minus dt.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,220
I will add integrals

31
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,420
and logarithm of absolute value. At

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,259
is minus t plus some constant. And I will

33
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,000
choose one simple solution 

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,700
of this equation. So, I will consider C

35
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,520
equal to zero. So, I will simplify the

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,799
problem, as much as possible, and then I

37
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,320
will modify my simple solution. So, I will

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,600
consider C equal to zero, so, I will

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,660
simplify, as much as possible. I will

40
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,300
choose At greater than 0. And, so, finally,

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,760
my At is just exponent of minus t.

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,319
Okay,

43
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,440
the first step is done.

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,819
I have a solution of a much simpler

45
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,239
equation. And now I will modify this

46
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,660
solution to match the Rt from original

47
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,480
equation. Let's do this.

48
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,160
Okay, I will consider Rt, as my simple

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,519
solution At, that is just exponent of

50
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,599
minus t times some modification

51
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,760
correction term Bt.

52
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,720
So, this is a simple solution

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,760
of wrong differential equation. This is

54
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,800
simple solution of another differential

55
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,239
equation. And this is a correction factor,

57
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,000
because my equation for R is not an

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,140
equation for A, they are different.

59
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,840
And I will plug in this Rt in my

60
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,000
original equation. So, I will need to use

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,540
the Ito's formula for Rt. So, the Ito's

62
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,379
formula for Rt says, that

63
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,840
I should take first derivatives, I should

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,239
take second derivatives. Okay, let's do it.

65
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,180
First, derivative with respect to A is

66
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,140
just Bt. So, I will have Bt times dAt 

67
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,080
plus. I apply Ito's lemma mod for

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,400
At times Bt. So, I will get At times dBt

69
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,140
plus.

70
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,580
Here I have

71
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,280
one over two times the second

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,980
derivative with respect to A is

73
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,080
zero, so, it is zero times Da squared plus.

74
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,900
What is a mixed partial derivative with

75
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,140
respect to A to B is just one. So, I will

76
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:19,459
have 2 times 1 times dAt times dBt

77
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,800
plus, what is the second derivative with

78
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,220
respect to BT, is 0 times DBT squared.

79
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,400
Okay, let's simplify everything I know.

80
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,380
Okay At is known, dAt is known, this is 0,

81
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,860
this is 0. Okay, let's look at this

82
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,080
term dAta times DBT.

84
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,180
Bt is a correction term, I don't know or

85
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,520
it's a little process, I don't know, it's

86
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,520
structure, but it's something like Dt

87
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,699
plus something like dWt.

88
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,320
And what is about dAt? 

89
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,360
It is minus exponent of minus T

90
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,400
times Dt. So, this is just minus A of T

91
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,080
times Dt.

92
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,780
And I need to multiply

93
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,240
these two expressions,

94
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,680
using Ito's rule. but Dt times Dt is 0, Dt

95
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,460
times dWt is zero. Okay, that's very

96
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,300
simple.

97
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,000
So, now I have an expression for dRt. dRt

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,180
is Bt. Bt, I don't know, it will be pity.

99
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,360
What is dAt?

100
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,419
It is minus exponent of minus t times t

101
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,620
Plus

102
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,300
What is At. At is exponent of minus

103
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,100
t times dBt.

104
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,740
But from the other hand, finally, I can

105
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,199
use original

106
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,699
expression. dRt should be this

107
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,860
expression.

108
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,340
And I just use this original

109
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,060
expression, so, I will copy it. It is 0 0 5

110
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,759
minus, what is Rt. It's At exponent of

111
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,979
minus t

112
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,800
times correction Bt

113
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,759
times Dt plus 2d

114
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,580
Wt. Okay, let's look at this expression.

115
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,919
I have Bt times minus exponent

116
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,880
times Dt. The same term Bt exponent

117
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,840
and Dt. Okay, it will disappear.

118
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,039
What will I get? I will get here.

119
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,380
Let's move on.

120
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,500
So, I will have

121
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,780
exponent of minus t times dBt.

123
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,280
What are the remaining terms?

124
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,440
In the right hand side,
125
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,360
I have 0 0 5 times Dt plus 2 times

126
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,500
dWt. Whoa! That means, that dBt

127
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,780
is just equal to

128
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,680
0 0 5 times exponent of T times

129
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,000
Dt

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,800
plus 2

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,199
times exponent of t dWt.

132
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,720
Yoo-hoo! I'm happier! Why I'm happy?

133
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,919
I'm happy, because this expression for

134
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,539
dBt has no unknown  stochastic

135
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,060
processes, in the right hand side. This is

136
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,720
something deterministic. This is just

137
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,180
expression with exponent t dWt, it's

138
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,560
easy to simulate it. I'm happy.

139
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,660
And, finally, Bt.

140
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,699
Bt is some B0

141
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,740
plus integral from 0 to t 0 0 5 exponent

142
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,319
of t

143
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,780
exponent of U. I need a new name for a

144
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,000
variable Du plus integral from 0 to

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,159
T to exponent of U dWu

146
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,140
and 

148
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,820
my RT is just a product of At

149
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,519
times Bt.

150
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:03,000
At is exponent of minus t. Bt is

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,660
completely known. The only mystery is

152
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,200
just this B0. Everything else

153
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,380
 we can either explicitly calculate

154
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,100
this integral and for this integral, it

155
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,380
cannot be expressed in terms of

156
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,380
elementary functions, but it's easy to

157
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,540
simulate it. So, okay, this we made

158
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,240
calculate this integral. Or the

159
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,459
second one, it's easy to simulate it. What

160
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:30,860
is B0?

161
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,399
But how to calculate B0? I know that R0

162
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,660
is 0 0 7. R0 is 0 0 7.

164
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,160
0 is just one I plug in.

165
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,080
So, I may conclude, that B0

166
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,300
should be 0 0 7, because

167
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,800
R0 is a product of  0 times B0. And,

168
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,640
hence, our  equation is completely

169
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,459
solved. I may write a very long

170
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,700
expression, but that's the answer, it's

171
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,779
hard.

172
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,279
Let me write it. So, I need to write At

173
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,060
exponent of minus t times a big, big, big,

174
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,600
big, big, big expression. So, I will get 0 0 7.

175
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,180
plus

176
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,920
integral from 0 to t 0 0 5

177
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,680
exponent of U

178
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,760
Du plus stochastic integral

179
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,079
from 0 to T to

180
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:50,579
exponent of U times dWu. And we need to

181
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,760
close bracket. So, that's the expression

182
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,779
for Rt in the  Yc check interest rate

183
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,240
model. This integral we may calculate it.

184
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,600
It's not hard to do. So, it will be 0 0 5.

186
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:08,940
exponent of Uu

187
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,459
changes from 0 up to T. And it will be

188
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:19,800
0 0 5 exponent of T minus one

189
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,779
and the second integral,

190
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,540
we cannot simplify it, but it's easy to

191
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,040
simulate it

192
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,880
with computer simulated.

193
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,240
So, using  Ito's lemma, we  may have found the

194
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,700
solution of velocity interest rate model.

195
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,600
we have explicit formula for the

196
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,700
interest rate, we can simulate it, we can

197
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,760
study its properties and so on.
