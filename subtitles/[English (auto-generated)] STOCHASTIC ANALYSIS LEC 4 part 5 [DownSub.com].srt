3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,519
In this video we will discus delta hedging.

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,679
We will start with obtaining expression

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,200
for dXt using Ito's lemma.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,980
Then we will give the formula for dXt using replicating strategy idea.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,900
And, finally, we will obtain a simple

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,160
receipt for replication strategy.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,320
Okay, the price of a claim XT is a function

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,500
of share prices T and time T. So, Xt is

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,040
some function X of St and t. Why it is so?

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,700
Because we have some replicating

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,059
strategy. And, so, to replicate our

18
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,300
financial claim, we need to make some initial investment.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,320
And the initial investments, we will do

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,100
them in the shares and in bonds. So, but

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,500
the bond price is a function of T. It's

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,260
non-stochastic. The share price St is

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,439
known. So, we know how much to invest to

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,659
start replicating strategy. And, basically,

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,799
Xt should depend only on St and T. We

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,740
don't know the formula. We know it, but it

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,540
cannot depend on some additional terms.

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,040
Using it as layer month, we obtain

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,560
expression for dXt. It's a first

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,840
derivative with respect to T times Dt

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,580
plus the first derivative with respect

33
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,700
to S times times Ds plus Ito's correction term 1 over 2 times the,

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,540
second derivative Dx with respect to

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,799
DS, DS times Ds squared.

37
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,400
But from as a viewpoint we know, that the

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,220
final answer will simplify somehow, I

39
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,220
don't know how yet. It will simplify up

40
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,320
to something times DT plus something

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,920
times dWt. I don't care, basically, about

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,939
the term before Dt, I will focus on the

43
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,119
term before dWt.

44
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,038
Let's do this.

45
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,739
Once again, we have an expression using Ito's lemma,

47
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,300
and we know the structure of the answer,

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,840
that is Dx, dXt equals to something times

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,900
Dt plus something times dWt.

50
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,860
There are no dWt in dSt square root,

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,940
because according to

52
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,239
mnemonic rules, Dt times Dt is 0, Dt

53
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,580
times dWtt is 0, and Dt dWt times dWt is

54
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,680
Dt. When you square dSt, you cannot get

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,440
dWt. Okay, so, only in dSt we have dWt, more

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,120
exactly, dSt is sigma times St times dWt.

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:04,280
Okay, so, the shorthand notation for dXt is something times Dt, 

61
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,560
I don't care about this term times this

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,340
term, I care about. Dx times Ds times

63
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,340
sigma St times dWt.

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,019
Okay, let's calculate dXt the other way.

66
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,900
Let's use the replicating portfolio idea.

67
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,620
Imagine, we have Yt shares and Zt bonds

68
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,780
in our portfolio. So, the price of

69
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,379
portfolio Xt is Yt times s t plus ZT

70
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,060
times BT. That's just the balance.

72
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,720
Okay, but the interpretation of

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,060
stochastic integral is a net cash flow.

74
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,400
So, Xt is equal to X0 plus integral from

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,120
0 to tYu times dSu. So, that's a

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,920
net flow from shares plus integral

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,239
from 0 to T times Zu times gBu, that is

78
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,920
the cash flow from bonds. And my strategy

79
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,200
is self-financing. My portfolio is self

80
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,918
financing. So, these two flows should

81
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,079
compensate each other.

82
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,040
Or in short form dXt is YT times dSt

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,639
plus ZT times DBT.

84
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,160
Once again, we need to recap the idea,

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,380
that's stochastic integral represents

86
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,280
the net cash flow.

87
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,680
And in Black and Scholes model we know, that

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,860
DsT is Mu StDt, I don't care about this

89
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,979
term plus. That's important sigma St

90
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:48,060
times dWt, and dBt is non-stochastic at

91
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,699
all, dBt is Bt times Dt.

92
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:56,500
Okay, so, if I focus on dWt term once again.

95
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:06,020
I just have the same equations. And let's focus on

97
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,780
the term before dWt.

98
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,919
Here it's just Yt times sigma St

99
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,400
times dWt.

100
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
Bingo!

101
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,960
We have an informal theorem to replicate

102
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,340
a European type claim with price X of St,

103
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,419
and t we should hold YT shares, and ZT

104
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,440
bonds, where YT is just DX with respect

105
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,800
to DS. So, the number of shares, we need to

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,520
have in our portfolio, is the derivative

107
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,280
of the portfolio price with respect to the share price.

110
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,199
That's called the delta hedging rule.

111
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,800
And we all obviously can find out the

112
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,500
number of bonds. The total price of

113
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,820
portfolio is Xt. We have Yt shares. So, Xt

114
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,639
minus total price of shares Xt minus

115
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,580
YtSt the total price of all bonds. We

116
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,100
divide by the price of one bond by BT.

117
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,400
And we get, that T is the number of bonds.

118
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,199
Okay, so, that's a very simple rule, that

119
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,380
gives you explicit receipt, how to

120
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,979
replicate any European type claim.

121
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,800
Obviously, you need to have the formula X

122
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,740
of St and t, but we have the pricing

123
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,560
formula. So, Bingo! We have the pricing

124
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
formula for for every European type

125
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,479
asset. And we have a rule how to

126
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,360
replicate every European type asset.

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,740
Let's proceed to the summary.

128
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,280
We have obtained two expressions for the

129
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,340
evolution of price of any financial

130
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,699
claim. It's dXt is equal to something

131
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,800
times Dt plus Dx, Dx over Ds times sigma

132
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,600
times sTdwt. The other expression for the

133
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,660
evolution of the price of any financial

134
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,300
claim is dXt equals to something times

135
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,600
Dt plus Yt times sigma times St times

136
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,220
dWt.

137
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,720
These expressions before dWt equal. So,

138
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,380
we have the delta hedging rule: that to

139
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,639
replicate any financial claim, we need to

140
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,080
have in our portfolio Yt shares, where Yt

141
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,979
is the derivative of the portfolio price,

142
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,580
Dx with respect  to the share price Ds

143
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,840
at that moment of time.

144
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,440
That was the last video in our short

145
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,440
introduction. It was rather hard from the

146
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,599
mathematical viewpoint, but let me thank you.
