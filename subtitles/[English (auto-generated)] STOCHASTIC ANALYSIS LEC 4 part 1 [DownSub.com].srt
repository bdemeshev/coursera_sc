3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,899
This lecture is about option pricing.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,720
In the first video we will discuss

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,660
discounted price process. We will start

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,360
by recalling, what discount it is in

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,660
continuous in discrete time. Then we will

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,180
state the theorem, that says, that every

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,359
european type asset can be replicated.

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,900
And then we will look at the pricing formula.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,900
Okay, if XT is a price of a claim at time

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,559
moment T, we can re-express the same

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,399
future price and the current prices.

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,860
And in discrete time it's very easy. We

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,320
just divide Xt by 1 plus R power T or

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,760
just 1 plus R power minus T times Xt. In

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,219
continuous time it's little bit more

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,239
interesting. We divide Xt by exponent of

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,080
R power T or we divide Xt by exponent

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,040
of RT, or we multiply Xt by exponent of

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,280
minus RT. Then the discounting in

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,740
continuous time. What's the reason behind

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,900
this formula? The reason behind this

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,360
formula is the following exponent of R

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,540
for small R according to the to the

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,939
Taylor expansion is approximately equal

29
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,640
to 1 plus R.

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,060
And it's much easier to work with

31
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,159
exponent of R in continuous time,

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,860
because you can take derivative, you can

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,259
take logarithm and so on.

34
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,720
And just a small reminder:  if T is equal

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,360
to 0, then the discounted price and the

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,900
price are equal, because the multiplier

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,500
exponent minus RT or 1 plus R power

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,420
minus T are equal to 1.

39
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,659
Okay, let's ask the following question: is

40
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,360
a discounted share price a martingale?

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,540
It seems, that okay on average the share

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,380
price should grow, but, maybe, if we speak

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,479
about discounted share price, it will be

44
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,540
a martingale. Okay, let's use it, as lemma,

45
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,720
and let's calculate  the differential

46
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,060
of discounted share price.

47
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,400
First, we start with Ito's lemma. We have

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,160
minus R times exponent of minus Rt

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,760
times St Dt plus exponent of minus Rt

50
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,319
dSt. We may meet the second derivative,

51
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,940
because the second derivative with

52
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,400
respect to S2s is zero.

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,459
We simplify, where we rearrange the terms,

54
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,760
and we get exponent of minus Rt times St times.

56
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,400
In the brackets we have mu minus R times

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,379
Dt plus sigma times dWt.

58
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,540
So, the answer is no.

59
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,319
Under probability P short form has Dt inside it.

61
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,840
And when short form has Dt inside the

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,720
process is not a martingale.

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,319
So, S0 we cannot calculate, that 0 is the

64
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,260
expected value of discounted price.

65
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:22,080
But let's recall once again, that formula for differential, for

67
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,200
discounted share price it is exponent

68
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,620
minus rtSt times very familiar bracket.

69
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,860
Mu minus R times Dt plus sigma times dWt.

70
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,560
This familiar bracket is just sigma

71
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,340
times dWt star. Wow, that means, that

72
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,080
differential of discounted share price

73
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,739
is just exponent minus Rt times St

74
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,799
times sigma times dWt star. Wow, it has no

75
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,739
Dt term inside it. So, on the probability P star

77
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,860
short form has no Dt term inside.

78
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,280
Wt star is a Wiener process. And, hence,

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,099
the discounted share price is a

80
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,940
martingale under probability P star. So,

81
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,260
S0 is equal to expected value star of

82
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,860
future discounted price exponent minus

83
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,220
Rt times St, given current information,

84
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,380
that is described by sigma algebra F0.

85
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,620
Now let's move on to the next topic the replicating strategy.

87
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,880
And in the Black and Scholes model, every

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,820
european type asset can be replicated by

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,639
a self-financing strategy, that trades

90
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,820
shares and risk-free bonds.

91
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,759
At time T the portfolio contains Yt

92
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,300
shares and Zt bonds. So, the price of

93
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,639
portfolio Xt is equal to Yt times St, the

94
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,380
total price of all shares in the

95
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,280
portfolio plus Zt times Bt, the total

96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,100
price of all risk-free bonds in the

97
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,540
portfolio.

98
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,620
But a strategy is self-financing the dXt

99
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,020
is equal to Yt times dSt plus Zt times

100
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,199
dBt, because we recall, that the meaning

101
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,320
of a stochastic integral is just the net

102
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,039
cash flow, when you have Yt shares, and

103
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,220
the share price is after the letter D.

104
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,340
Just a small remark european type asset

105
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:50,380
gives you a specified payoff at a fixed time moment big T.

108
00:05:50,340 --> 00:06:00,699
And, once again, self financing strategy means that there are no exogenous capital inflow or outflow.

111
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,860
And, finally, let's test, let's State the

112
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,539
pricing formula.

113
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:16,419
As every asset can be replicated, using bonds and using share price.

116
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,460
And they discounted or price of a bond

117
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,860
is just a constant, the discount share

118
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,479
price is a martingale.

119
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,479
And every portfolio is a combination of

120
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,479
these two. So, we get the following informal theorem

122
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,319
in the Black and Scholes model the discounted price of every of any

124
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,800
European type asset is a martingale

125
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
under probability P star. Hence, the price

126
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,180
of any European type claim X0 is just

127
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,080
exponent minus Rt times expected value

128
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
star of future value

129
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,840
Xt given current information current

130
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,199
sigma algebra F0.

131
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,740
Once again Wt star is a Wiener process,

132
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,979
but on the probability P star not on the

133
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,440
probability P.

134
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,520
The link between Wt, and Wt star is Mu

135
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,139
minus rDt plus sigma times dWt equals to

136
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,620
sigma times dWt star.

137
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,099
And just a small reminder, what is the idea of the proof

139
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,520
of this theorem. Because every European

140
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,500
type asset can be replicated using

141
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
trading shares and bonds, discounted bond

142
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,380
price is constant, discounted share price

143
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,419
is a martingale, and the probability

144
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,900
measure P star. So, basically, the theorem

145
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,560
follows from this idea.

146
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,680
Let's proceed to the summary. European

147
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,120
claim gives payoff at a fixed specified

148
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,419
in the contract moment of time T.

149
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,599
The discounted price of any European

150
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,900
type claim is a martingale on the P star.

151
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,720
So, to calculate the price, we need to

152
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,900
calculate one expected value.

153
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,860
And the other main idea, that every

154
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,819
European type claim may be replicated.

155
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,560
And the pricing formula here it is X0 is

156
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,800
equal to exponent of minus Rt times

157
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,458
expected value star of Xt given current

158
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:38,880
information described by sigma algebra F0.
