00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,839
In this video we will introduce

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,540
Ito integral or stochastic integral. Our

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,460
introduction will be informal and

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,460
intuitive, because rigorous introduction

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,940
requires the concept of limits.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,020
And we will not discuss it in our

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,680
introductory course, but our informal

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,960
definition will be enough to calculate

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,800
some simple examples and to work with

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,820
stochastic integral.

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,660
Let's define the Ito integral from 0 to

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,399
T of some stochastic process Au times

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,480
dWu, as a total net cash flow of a

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,980
strategy. If we treat Wu, as a price of

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,039
an asset at time moment U, and the Au, as

18
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,180
a quantity of the asset we have at time

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,940
moment U.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,340
We agree, that WT is a bad model for the

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,040
price process, because for example WT may

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,740
be negative, and in most cases the price

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,560
cannot be negative, but the intuition is

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,320
perfectly fine.

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,000
We once again define their net cash

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,659
flow of a trading strategy, as an

27
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,960
integral from 0 to T quantity at time

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,159
moment U times G price at time moment U.

29
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,400
So, after the left G we have price before

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,220
letter D, we have quantity.

31
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,799
Using this simple intuition, we can

32
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,960
calculate all the deterministic

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,340
integrals too.

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,040
For example, let's consider integral from

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,860
2 up to 8 of 7 times Du. So, where is the

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,079
price, where is the quantity? 7 is the

37
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,520
quantity, and U is a price at time U. Okay,

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,479
so, we have two transactions to deal

39
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,479
with. The first transaction at time U

40
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,459
equal to 2, we buy 7 units of acid.

41
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,520
And the price at time moment U is just

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,000
U. Because U is a letter after D and,

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,420
hence, the price is equal to two. Okay, our

44
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,420
cash flow is minus seven times two,

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,500
transaction 2. At final moment of time, at

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,040
time moment U equal to 8, we sell our

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,700
seven shares, our seven units of asset.

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,720
But the price now is eight, because U is

49
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,500
equal to 8. And, hence, our cash flow is

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,280
plus seven times eight. And, so, the total

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,980
net cash flow the value of an integral

52
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,739
is minus 14 plus 56, or it's equal to 42.

53
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,500
If you check this integral, using all the

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,840
rules, you will get exactly the same

55
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,560
answer, but this interpretation is very

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,980
powerful. We can calculate net cash flow

57
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,980
of a trading strategy, using integrals.

58
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,319
That's very powerful idea, but obviously

59
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,480
this integral is very simple.

60
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,480
Okay, the next one. What is the integral

61
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,720
from 2 up to 8 of 5 times dWu? Now the

62
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,800
quantity is 5, and the price is given by

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,860
the stochastic process W.

64
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,379
Okay, we have two transactions once again.

65
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,680
The first transaction at time moment U

66
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,340
equal to 2, we buy five units. So, the

67
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,140
price of each unit is W2. And, hence, our

68
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,120
net cash flow for the first transaction

69
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,500
is -5 times W2. Yes, once again we

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,680
remember, that W2 may be negative, but

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,900
that's okay.

72
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,420
And transaction number two at time

73
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,340
moment U equal to 8, we sell our five

74
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,120
units of the asset, but the price now is

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,298
W8. Hence, the cash flow of the second

76
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,320
transaction is five times W8.

77
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,139
And the value of the stochastic integral,
.
78
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,479
we have calculated our first stochastic

79
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,580
integral! Bingo! Is -5 times W2 plus 5

80
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,139
times W8.

81
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,960
And we will use the adjustments

82
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,660
agreement. We will denote the upper limit

83
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,040
of integration by T. And

84
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,100
varying time will be denoted by the

85
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,360
letter U, and U will ordinary 

86
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,180
range from 0 up to T.

87
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,139
The big problem with stochastic

88
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,960
integrals is, that all the integration

89
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,360
formals are wrong.

90
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,900
For example, let's try to calculate the

91
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,280
integral from 0 to TWU times dWu. It's

92
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,020
a very strange financial strategy,

93
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,479
because the quantity of an asset is

94
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,259
Wu, and the price of an asset is also Wu.

95
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,580
So, this strange strategy

96
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,160
prescribes us to

97
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,000
have two assets, two units of asset, if

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
the price is two. This strange strategy

99
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,120
prescribes us to have five units of

100
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,320
asset, if the price is five. Okay,

101
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,380
our all the intuition from Riemann

102
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,199
integral says, that should be one over

103
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,759
two WT squared minus one over two  W

104
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,419
0 squared, but it's wrong.

105
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,139
This guessed value is not negative,

106
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,080
because it's one over two times WT

107
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,419
squared, and it's zero or greater than

108
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,020
zero. But, obviously, when you are trying

109
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,840
to buy and sell Wiener process, if the

110
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,840
price changes randomly, then you can

111
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,500
obviously have negative net cash flow. So,

112
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,560
this all the answer is wrong.

113
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,819
So, we need new rules of integration.

114
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,060
In most cases the either integral cannot

115
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,280
be computed explicitly, it can be

116
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,039
simulated on computer. We can use its

117
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,039
properties, but 

118
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,759
in very rare cases we can obtain

119
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,699
explicit expression.

120
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,180
For our purposes three cases will be

121
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,100
enough. The integral from 0 to T of 1

122
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,940
times dWu is just WT.

123
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,460
The integral from 0 to T of WU times

124
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,819
dWu will be equal to WT squared minus T

125
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,539
over 2. And the last one the integral

126
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,759
from 0 to T of exponent of  a WU

127
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,539
minus 1 over 2 a square root U times dWu,

128
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,259
we have a formula for this case, but in

129
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,660
general, there are no easy rules of

130
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,860
integration. But let's pay attention 

131
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,680
for a small difference with ordinary

132
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,759
integral. The right hand side, the answer

133
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,259
sometimes can be positive, sometimes can

134
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,840
be negative. But if, for example you,

135
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,199
integrate a positive function from 0 to

136
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,080
T, you will receive a positive result,

137
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,539
when you are calculating ordinary

138
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,120
integral, and with stochastic integral it

139
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,259
can be negative with some probability.

140
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,560
Okay,


141
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,720
let's make a small summary, the

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,539
stochastic integral or Ito integral is a

143
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,900
total net cash flow of a strategy.

144
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,620
It can be rarely computed explicitly, but

145
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,139
it can be simulated.

146
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,020
And all rules of integration do not

147
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,020
apply, so, be careful, when you see a

148
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,780
stochastic integral with respect to Wu.
