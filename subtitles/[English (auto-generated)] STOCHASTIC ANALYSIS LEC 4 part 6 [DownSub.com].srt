3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,500
We will know, how to price  different contracts in

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,720
the Black and Scholes model. We

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,519
need just to calculate expected value.

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,920
And we have already considered a

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,279
contract, that pays you at time moment t

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,240
equal to 2 S2 cube. And we have found,

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,779
that the no-arbitrage price of this

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,480
claim is just  0 Cube times exponent of

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,720
4R plus 6 sigma squared.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,200
Okay, and it's also possible to replicate

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,860
this contract, this claim in the

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,960
framework of the Black and Scholes model. And

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,140
my question now is: how to start the

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,559
replicating portfolio? So, how many shares

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,980
I need to buy initially? How many units

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,940
of cash account I need to buy to

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,840
replicate these X0?

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,579
Okay, so, from one point of view

21
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:05,700
Xt can be completely replicated, using

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,780
shares and units of cash account. So, Xt

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,299
is just, if I buy Yt shares, so yt,

24
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,119
small y, is the number of shares. So, in

25
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,180
shares I have this sum of money. Yt is

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,340
the number of shares, St is a share

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,880
price. Plus I have Zt units of cash

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,820
account. So, I have Zt times Bt.

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,340
Bt is a cash account, what does it mean.

30
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,619
So, if in the beginning I have one dollar,

31
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,140
I invested in all. And

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,840
if B0 is one, then Bt is just exponent of

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,340
Rt. Okay, so, this is the price of my portfolio.

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,079
And by our interpretation of stochastic integral,

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:12,300
dXt is just Yt times dSt plus Zt

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,640
times dBt. Or we may write it like Yt

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,160
times, we just plug in the expression for

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:30,160
dSd. it will be mu St Dt plus sigma St dWt plus.

42
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,920
We also plug in the expression for dBt.

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,720
If Bt is just exponent of Rt, then we

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,739
have, dBt will be equal, we take the

45
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,200
derivative with respect to T. That's a

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,319
non-stochastic process. So, we have R

47
00:02:49,319 --> 00:03:00,040
times exponent of Rt times Dt or just R times Bt Dt.

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, so, we have that times R times Bt Dt.

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:19,760
Okay, let's focus on their coefficient before dTe. 

55
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,599
So, we have here

56
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:39,580
mu Yt St plus zTr Bt times Dt plus.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,060
And we have the the other term, that is Yt sigma St dWt.

62
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,200
Okay, that will be the term of interest.

64
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,099
Or more specifically we will look at this term.

66
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,819
Now let's recall, that Xt may be expressed,

68
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,220
as a function of St and t. Okay, we also

69
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:13,360
have another approach Xt is a function of T and St.

71
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,320
We haven't recovered this function

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,858
for urbanity, but it's possible. But we

73
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,380
know, for example, that X0 is just S0

74
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:34,340
cube times exponent of 4R plus sigma squared.

77
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,620
Okay, so, we may also derive the general

78
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,259
formula for XT, using the eXp the expected value star of discounted X2.

80
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:53,699
But our goal is to find

81
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,120
only the starting values of replicating portfolio. 

83
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,139
So, X0 will be sufficient. Okay, we will

84
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,419
apply it as Ito's lemma. Ito's lemma say, that

85
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,840
dXt should be equal to, what should be

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,699
equal to F of prime with respect to t times Dt

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
plus F prime with respect to S times dSt plus.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,900
It is correction term 1 over 2 times F

91
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,539
prime prime with respect to S with

92
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:34,220
respect to S times dSt squared.

96
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,699
Okay, let's plug in the expression for dSt.

98
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,220
We will have F Prime with respect to t times Dt plus

101
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,520
F Prime with respect to S

102
00:05:50,520 --> 00:06:09,340
times mu sTd d plus sigma St dWt.

106
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,020
Plus 1 over 2 F prime prime with respect

107
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,600
to S, what is DS squared?

108
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,720
If I will square this expression, I

109
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,280
will receive only sigma squared times

110
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:39,160
St squared times dWt squared, that is, that is equal to Dt.

113
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,479
And, basically, that's all. Okay,

114
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:54,319
let's look at our term with mu St. What is mu S?

116
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,919
Okay, in the first, so, I have two expressions.

118
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,860
For Xt, for dXt, I have two expressions for dXt.

120
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:10,259
And let us look at the coefficient before mu St.

122
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,319
So, I'm interested in a coefficient before mu St.

124
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,780
In the first expression, what is before muSt.

126
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,479
So, before mu St I have exactly

127
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,380
the number of shares, I need to hold in

128
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,380
my replication portfolio.

129
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,360
That is YT, the number of shares I need to have in

131
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,599
my replicating portfolio. What is the

132
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,740
expression before mu St 

134
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,500
muStdt, yeah, muStdt in the second expression.

136
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:54,740
In the second expression, before muStdt

138
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,020
I have F prime with respect to S,

139
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,440
and to make my portfolio, replicating

140
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,139
portfolio, I need to have these values equal.

142
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:17,819
So, Yt should be F prime with respect to S.

144
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,220
And, hence, I almost have everything I need.

146
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,340
So, Y0. The numbers of shares to start the

148
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,560
replicating portfolio is just the

149
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,958
derivative of my initial formula for X0.

151
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:46,620
So, I will take my initial formula plus 6 sigma squared.

154
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,920
And I will take the derivative with

155
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:59,560
respect to S. So, it will be 3, as 0 squared times

158
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:05,839
exponent of 4R plus 6 sigma squared.

159
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:16,380
And this value is equal to 3 times 100

161
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,040
times exponent of 4R. R is 0 0 5, so, 4R is

162
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,640
0 2 6 sigma squared is 0 0 6.

163
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:35,500
So, I have 0 26 here.

165
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:48,220
And it will be 3 times, 100 times, approximately, 1.3.

169
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,180
And I will have here, this is

170
00:09:51,180 --> 00:10:01,120
approximately. And I will have, and I will have roughly 390 shares. 

173
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:09,640
So, to start the replicating portfolio I need roughly

175
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:19,160
390 shares, and which some should be invested in the cash account.

179
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,779
So what is the value of zero? What is

180
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:35,399
zero? But that 0 is just X0 minus Y0 times S0.

182
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:41,800
Because at the moment time t equal to 0, the price of

184
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,820
one dollar is one dollar. If the price of

185
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,720
my portfolio is X0 at start, and

186
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,500
I'm replicating it using  Y0

187
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,920
shares, each of them has a price, as 0.

188
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,200
So, this is the price, this is the number

189
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,079
of dollars, I need to have to start the

190
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,680
replicating portfolio. Okay, and we will

191
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:30,700
have 1297, approximately, minus 390 times, the price of one share is 10.

198
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:44,800
So, I will have 1297 minus 3090 nine hundreds. This value will be

202
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,100
negative. That's completely okay, because

203
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,279
in the replicating portfolio we may

204
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,740
borrow, that means. So what does it

205
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,899
mean negative or number of dollars? So,

206
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,100
that means, we need to borrow.

207
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,360
And, hence, the value is. So, we

208
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,100
obtain - 2603 dollars.

210
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,399
Okay, so, we not only know the initial

211
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:26,120
price X0. X0 is roughly 1297 dollars. So,

213
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,740
that's the initial price of our claim.

214
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,399
But we know, how to start the replicating

215
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,640
portfolio for this claim? To replicate we

216
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:42,240
need to borrow, so, we need to borrow

218
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:57,420
2603 dollars and to buy 390 shares.

224
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,720
This is the start value of replicating

225
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,540
portfolio, and then we will just continue

226
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,519
to use their identity, that dynamically,

228
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,880
we will use identity, that Yt should be

229
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,399
always equal to F prime with respect to

230
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,440
current share price. So, if we will

231
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,500
maintain this equality every time, then

232
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:32,980
we will obtain the replicating portfolio for our claim.

235
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:39,960
