00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,960
In this video we will discuss the properties of

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,360
stochastic integral.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,219
First, we will start with the common

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,519
properties of Ito integral with our old

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,580
friend Riemann integral. Then we

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,800
will discuss a very simple property, that

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,560
the expected value of

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,619
Ito integral is just 0. And then, we will

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,340
discuss Ito isometry, that can be used

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,260
to calculate the variance of a

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,120
stochastic integral.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,760
Let's start with some basic properties,

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,300
that are common between Riemann integral

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,579
and stochastic integral with respect to

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,040
dWu.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,559
If you have two non-overlapping time

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,760
intervals, the time interval from A to B

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,239
plus integral with the interval from B

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,059
to C, you can just use the common

22
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,219
interval from A to C of XudWu.

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,559
The second property: if you integrate

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,740
from A to A, then you have no time to

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,500
make money, and your net cash flow is

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,619
zero. And the last property, that you can

27
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,619
move out constant out of the integral,

28
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,619
that is a common property of Ito

29
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,640
integral and the agreement integral.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,659
Now the property, that stochastic

31
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,659
integral has zero expected value. The

32
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,659
intuition here is very very simple: if

33
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,020
you buy and sell the Wiener process, so,

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,259
if the price is completely random, it may

35
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,439
go up and down with equal probability, so,

36
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,579
intuition says, that the expected net

37
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,579
cash flow should be zero. And, indeed, we

38
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,500
have informal theorem, that for any

39
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,960
reasonable process XT measurable with

40
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
respect to the natural filtration FT of

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,439
the Wiener process WT, expected value of

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,680
stochastic integral from 0 to T, of XU

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,580
times dWu, is zero.

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,120
And there is a property, that is called

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,140
Ito isometry, that describes how to

46
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,120
calculate the variance of stochastic

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,459
integral. So, the variance of integral

48
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,560
from 0 to T, of X U times dWu, is equal to

49
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,739
ordinary integral, old Riemann integral

50
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,640
from 0 to T, of expected value of XU

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,319
squared times DU.

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,900
Let's solve an exercise.

53
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,040
Let's find expected value of I of T and

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,000
variance of I of T, if I of T is an

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,480
integral from 0 to T of WU squared

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,840
times dWu.

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,900
Let's start with expected value OH, it's

58
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,640
simple, it's just zero.

59
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,340
Now, what about the variance?

60
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,560
We just square the stochastic process

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,220
inside the integral, so, it will be double

62
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,360
WU power 4. We calculate expected value

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,260
of it, and we integrate with respect

64
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,040
to W with respect to DU and not with

65
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
respect to dWu.

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,220
And, hence, we know, that expected value of

67
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,080
W power 4 is just 3U squared, and

68
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,319
the integral of this expression is just

69
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,159
T cube.

70
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,000
So, let's recap the properties of Ito

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,260
integral. It has zero expected value,

72
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,200
that's very simple.

73
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,019
Using the property, that is called Ito

74
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,959
isometry, one may calculate the variance

75
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,540
of a stochastic integral.

76
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,900
There are some common properties of

77
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,019
Ito integral and Riemann integral, but be

78
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,680
careful, in general, old integration rules

79
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,640
do not apply.
