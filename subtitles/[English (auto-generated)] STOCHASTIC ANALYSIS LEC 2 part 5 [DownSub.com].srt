3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:07,379
Let's consider the properties of a

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,720
stochastic integral. We consider the

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,380
stochastic integral from 0 to TW power

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,580
4 times U times dWu. We know, that any

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,520
stochastic integral under some mild

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,500
conditions is a martingale with zero

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,439
expected value. So, the first question is

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,439
just is it like a cake. The expected

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,280
value of Ip is just zero. We are happy.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,320
Now for the variance.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,680
Let's use Ito isometry now. Let's say, that

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,239
variance of IT is expected value of IT,

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,140
and can be calculated, as ordinary bream

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,180
and integral. Integral from 0 to T.

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,199
We put

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,039
the expected value of square inside.

19
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,940
So, we calculate expected value of Wu

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,500
power 8 times U squared. And we change dWu

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,560
by just ordinary DU. Okay, that's

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,479
simple to calculate. We recall, that  WU

23
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,100
has the same distribution, as a square

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,960
root of U times Z, where Z is a standard

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,979
normal random variable. And the

26
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,680
expected value of Z power 8 is 7 times 5

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,680
times 3 times 1, that is a double

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,600
factorial.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,780
And, hence, our expected value is almost

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,380
found. So, we get integral from 0 to T

31
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,340
expected value of square root of U

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:04,320
power 8 times Z power 8 times U squared

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,799
DU. We get

34
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,739
integral from 0 to T

35
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,620
U power 4

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,680
times U power 2 times 7 times 5 times 3

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,060
DU.

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,160
We got

39
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,840


40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,900
integral from 0 to T

41
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,660
or 105 times U power 6 DU.

42
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,540
And, finally, we get 105 times U to the

43
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,879
power 7 divided by 7 U changes from zero

44
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,700
to T. And we get

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,599

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,099
15

47
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,780
times

48
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,019
T power 7.

49
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,920
And that's all.

50
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,860
Okay, we have calculated variance. Now

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,860
let's move on to covariance.

52
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,640
We need to calculate covariance of our

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,620
integral with  double UT squared.

54
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,260
Our main idea is the following: it's easy

55
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,800
to calculate, using Ito isometry the

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,200
covariance between integrals. So, it's

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,780
better to represent WT squared, as an

58
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,140
integral, because IT is already an

59
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,840
integral

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,400
of Wu power 4 times UDWU. So, it's

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,280
better to represent WT squared, as an

62
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,000
integral. How we may represent WT

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
squared, as an integral?

64
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,580
We may say, that it's WT squared minus t,

65
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,260
that is from our integral tables plus T,

66
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,980
and, so, we get, that this is basically 

67
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,680
integral from 0 to T2 times WUDWU plus t.

68
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,400

69
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,819
Hence, we plug in both these integrals

70
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,298
into covariance. So, we have covariance of

71
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,680
integral from 0 to TWU power 4 times U

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,699
dWu with integral from 0 to T to

73
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:31,979
WUDW U plus t.

74
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,300

75
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,800
This plus T is a non-random quality. It

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,280
does not influence the covariance, so, we

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,380
just get rid of this T.

78
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,100


79
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,560
We need to calculate covariance

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,660
between two integrals. And covariance

81
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,340
between two integrals is just original

82
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,699
integral from 0 to T expected value of

83
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,160
the product of expressions inside

84
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,759
integrals. So, we need to multiply these

85
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,380
values,

86
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,080
and to take expected value of the

87
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,220
product.

88
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,000
So, we have here WU power 4 times U

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,860
times 2 WU.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,360
And we use ordinary ariemann integral by

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,500
Ito  isometry.

92
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
We get UN2 out of expected value out

93
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,759
of integral.  2U integral from 0 to

94
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,759
T expected value of WU power 5 times DU.

95
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,100
This is odd power of Wu.

96
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,020
So, the expected value of odd power of 

97
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,600
scaled standard normal random variable

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,160
is just zero. So, we got zero covariance.

99
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,259
And finally, let's calculate our

100
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,300
conditional expected value. Let's

101
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,820
calculate conditional expected value of

102
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,639
I6 given I4.

103
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,520
We use the property of stochastic

104
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,120
integral, that stochastic integral is a

105
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,900
martingale.

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,699
And, hence, the last question is also easy,

107
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,759
as it's a martingale, the best prediction

108
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,180
of its future value, if you know 
109
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,600
current value is the current value.

110
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,020
So, it's I4, and it's integral from 0 to 4

111
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,180
Wu

112
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,280
power 4 times U times dWu.

113
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,919
Unfortunately, the explicit value of

114
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,400
stochastic integral can be calculated in

115
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,060
general, only in some rare cases we can

116
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,180
get the stochastic integral explicitly

117
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,120
without the integral sign.

118
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,020
